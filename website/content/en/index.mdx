# AI Workflow

**Your AI is smart. But every session starts from zero.**

Every time you open a new chat, you re-explain the same frameworks, best practices, and professional standards. **One command changes everything.**

```bash
npx add-skill nicepkg/ai-workflow/workflows/content-creator-workflow
```
