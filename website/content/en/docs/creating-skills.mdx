# Creating Skills

Skills are reusable instructions that extend your AI assistant's capabilities. This guide shows you how to create your own skills.

## Skill Structure

Each skill is a folder containing at least a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: Skill definition
├── scripts/              # Optional: Helper scripts
│   └── helper.py
├── templates/            # Optional: File templates
│   └── template.md
└── references/           # Optional: Reference materials
    └── guide.md
```

## SKILL.md Format

The `SKILL.md` file defines your skill:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: A brief description of what this skill does
triggers:
  - "keyword1"
  - "keyword2"
---

# My Skill

## Overview
Explain what this skill does and when to use it.

## Instructions
Step-by-step instructions for the AI to follow.

### Step 1: Analyze
Describe the first step...

### Step 2: Execute
Describe the second step...

## Examples

### Example 1
Show an example input and expected output.

## Notes
Any additional context or warnings.
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Instructions
Write instructions that are:
- Specific and actionable
- Broken into numbered steps
- Include examples where helpful

### 2. Appropriate Scope
Each skill should:
- Do one thing well
- Be reusable across projects
- Not overlap with other skills

### 3. Good Naming
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `my-skill-name`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Avoid generic names like `helper` or `utils`

## Adding to a Workflow

1. Create your skill folder in `.claude/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill
```

2. Create the `SKILL.md` file:

```bash
touch .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

3. Edit `SKILL.md` with your skill definition

4. Test the skill with your AI assistant

## Example Skill

Here's a complete example of a documentation skill:

```markdown
---
name: write-docs
description: Generate documentation for code
triggers:
  - "document this"
  - "write docs"
  - "add documentation"
---

# Documentation Generator

## Overview
Generates comprehensive documentation for code files, functions, and modules.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze the Code
- Identify the purpose of the code
- Note all public functions and classes
- Understand the input/output types

### Step 2: Generate Documentation
- Write a module-level docstring
- Document each public function
- Include parameter types and return values
- Add usage examples

### Step 3: Review
- Ensure documentation is accurate
- Check for completeness
- Verify examples work

## Output Format
Use the project's existing documentation style. Default to:
- JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Docstrings for Python
- XML comments for C#

## Example

Input:
\`\`\`python
def calculate_total(items, tax_rate):
    subtotal = sum(item.price for item in items)
    return subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)
\`\`\`

Output:
\`\`\`python
def calculate_total(items: list[Item], tax_rate: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the total price including tax.

    Args:
        items: List of items to calculate total for
        tax_rate: Tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)

    Returns:
        Total price including tax

    Example:
        >>> items = [Item(price=10), Item(price=20)]
        >>> calculate_total(items, 0.08)
        32.4
    """
    subtotal = sum(item.price for item in items)
    return subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)
\`\`\`
```
