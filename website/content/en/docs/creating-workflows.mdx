# Creating Workflows

Workflows are curated collections of skills designed for specific use cases. This guide shows you how to create your own workflows.

## Method 1: AI-Assisted Creation (Recommended)

The easiest way to create a workflow is to let your AI assistant do it for you.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicepkg/ai-workflow.git
cd ai-workflow
```

### Step 2: Open with AI Coding Assistant

Open the project with any AI tool that supports skills:
- **Claude Code**: `claude` in terminal
- **Cursor**: Open folder in Cursor
- **Codex**: `codex` in terminal
- **OpenCode**: `opencode` in terminal

### Step 3: Ask AI to Create Your Workflow

Simply describe what you need:

```
"Create a researcher workflow for academic paper writing"
"Create a devops workflow for kubernetes management"
"Create a data-scientist workflow for ML projects"
```

The AI will automatically:
1. Create the workflow directory structure
2. Find and download relevant skills from skill sources
3. Create custom skills as needed
4. Generate documentation (README.md, AGENTS.md)
5. Set up symlinks for all AI tools

## Method 2: Manual Creation

For full control over the workflow structure.

### Workflow Structure

```
workflows/my-workflow/
├── README.md              # User documentation
├── AGENTS.md              # AI instructions
├── .claude/
│   ├── settings.json
│   └── skills/            # Primary skill storage
│       ├── skill-1/
│       │   └── SKILL.md
│       └── skill-2/
│           └── SKILL.md
├── .cursor/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
├── .codex/
│   └── skills -> ../.claude/skills
└── ... (other AI tool symlinks)
```

### Create Directory Structure

```bash
# Create workflow directory
mkdir -p workflows/my-workflow/.claude/skills

# Create settings file
echo '{"permissions": {}}' > workflows/my-workflow/.claude/settings.json

# Create documentation files
touch workflows/my-workflow/README.md
touch workflows/my-workflow/AGENTS.md
```

### Create Symlinks

```bash
cd workflows/my-workflow

# Create directories for each AI tool
mkdir -p .cursor .codex .opencode .agents .kilocode .roo .goose .gemini .agent .github .factory .windsurf

# Create symlinks
ln -s ../.claude/skills .cursor/skills
ln -s ../.claude/skills .codex/skills
ln -s ../.claude/skills .opencode/skill
ln -s ../.claude/skills .agents/skills
ln -s ../.claude/skills .kilocode/skills
ln -s ../.claude/skills .roo/skills
ln -s ../.claude/skills .goose/skills
ln -s ../.claude/skills .gemini/skills
ln -s ../.claude/skills .agent/skills
ln -s ../.claude/skills .github/skills
ln -s ../.claude/skills .factory/skills
ln -s ../.claude/skills .windsurf/skills
ln -s .claude/skills skills
```

## Adding Skills

### Option 1: Download from Skill Sources

Skills can be sourced from:
- [Anthropic Official Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)
- [vercel-labs/agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills)
- [ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills)
- [skillhub.club](https://www.skillhub.club) - 1000+ skills collection

### Option 2: Create Custom Skills

Create a new skill in `.claude/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill
```

Create `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when AI should use it
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the AI to follow...
```

See [Creating Skills](/en/docs/creating-skills) for detailed guidance.

## Documentation

### README.md

Should include:
- Workflow purpose and target users
- List of included skills with descriptions
- Installation command
- Usage examples

### AGENTS.md

Provides context for AI assistants:
- Workflow overview
- Available skills and when to use them
- Output standards and best practices

## Publishing Your Workflow

1. Fork the [ai-workflow repository](https://github.com/nicepkg/ai-workflow)
2. Add your workflow to the `workflows/` directory
3. Update the main README.md with your workflow
4. Submit a pull request

Your workflow will be installable via:
```bash
npx add-skill nicepkg/ai-workflow/workflows/your-workflow
```
