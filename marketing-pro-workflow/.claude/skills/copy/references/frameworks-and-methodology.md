# Copywriting Frameworks and Methodology

Essential frameworks, formulas, and methodologies for conversion-focused copywriting.

## Hormozi Value Framework

Alex Hormozi treats copywriting as engineering the perception of value. Without an irresistible offer, good writing alone won't convert.

### The Value Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement)
        ÷ (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

The goal of your copy is to **maximize perceived value** and **minimize perceived cost**.

**Apply to every section:**

**Dream Outcome**

- Speak to the specific result customers deeply want
- Not: "Better marketing"
- Yes: "$100K revenue increase in 90 days"
- Make it vivid and specific

**Perceived Likelihood**

- Back the promise with proof
- Testimonials with specific results
- Case studies with numbers
- Authority signals (credentials, press)
- Guarantees reduce risk

**Time Delay**

- Stress speed to result
- Not: "Eventually you'll see results"
- Yes: "See your first lead within 24 hours"
- Shorter time = higher value

**Effort & Sacrifice**

- Reduce perceived friction
- "5-minute setup" vs "Complex onboarding"
- "No credit card required" vs "Payment upfront"
- "Works with your existing tools" vs "Complete migration needed"

### Core Copy Philosophy

#### Sell the Outcome, Not the Features

People don't care about features—they care about transformation.

**Bad:** "Our platform has advanced AI algorithms"
**Good:** "Go from 10 leads/month to 100 leads/month"

Your copy should articulate:

1. **Where the visitor is now** (struggling with X)
2. **The pain they feel** (wasting 3 hours/day)
3. **The after-state** (done in 5 minutes)

This drives the emotional hook.

#### "The Pain Is the Pitch"

Lead with the pain—describe the exact moment someone feels the problem (not vague generalities).

**Vague:** "Marketing is hard"
**Specific:** "You spend 3 hours crafting the perfect email campaign, hit send, and get 2% open rates. Again."

This makes your message **felt before it's believed**.

### Headline Strategy

Headlines do 80% of the conversion work. If people aren't intrigued immediately, nothing else matters.

#### Headline Formula

```
Get [Specific Result] in [Timeframe] With Less [Pain/Effort]
```

**Examples:**

- "Get 100 Qualified Leads in 30 Days Without Cold Calling"
- "Cut Support Tickets by 50% in One Week (No New Hires)"
- "Go From 10K to 100K Visitors in 6 Months (Without Paid Ads)"

#### Requirements

- **Short:** Under 15 words ideal
- **Clear:** Zero ambiguity
- **Outcome-oriented:** Transformation, not process
- **Specific:** Numbers, timeframes, concrete results
- **Undeniably valuable:** Must solve real pain

#### Headline Types

**Before-After-Bridge:**

```
Before: Spending hours on reports
After: 5-minute dashboards
Bridge: Our automated analytics
```

**Problem-Agitate-Solve:**

```
Problem: Manual data entry wastes 10 hours/week
Agitate: That's 520 hours/year you could spend on growth
Solve: AutoSync eliminates data entry completely
```

**Question-Answer:**

```
Question: Tired of chasing invoices?
Answer: Get paid in 3 days, automatically
```

**How-To:**

```
How to 10x Your Content Output Without Hiring Writers
```

### Offer Design = Copy

Copy isn't separate from offer design—they're the same system. What marketers call "good copy" is actually a **good offer expressed well**.

#### Offer Engineering

**1. Stack value elements:**

```
Main product: $997
+ Bonus 1: Template library ($297 value)
+ Bonus 2: 1-on-1 coaching call ($500 value)
+ Bonus 3: Lifetime updates (priceless)
= Total value: $1,794

Your investment today: $497
```

**2. Break offer into distinct benefits:**

Don't: "Complete marketing solution"
Do:

- Landing page templates (save 20 hours)
- Email sequences (proven 15% conversion)
- Analytics dashboard (see ROI instantly)

**3. Price anchored to value delivered:**

```
If this saves you 10 hours/week at $100/hour,
that's $1,000/week value = $52,000/year

Price: $997 one-time
Payback period: < 1 week
```

### Landing Page Application

#### Hero Section

**Formula:**

```
Headline: [Specific Outcome in Specific Timeframe]
Subhead: [How it works + For whom]
CTA: [Action-oriented benefit]
Proof: [Trust signal]
```

**Example:**

```
Headline: Turn 3-Hour Reports Into 5-Minute Dashboards
Subhead: Automated analytics for SaaS companies growing past $1M ARR
CTA: Start Your Free Trial
Proof: Trusted by 2,500+ SaaS companies
```

#### Proof & Credibility Section

All elements increase **perceived likelihood of achievement**:

**Social proof:**

- Specific results: "Increased conversion 47% in 30 days"
- Attributed testimonials: Name, photo, company, role
- Video testimonials: Highest credibility

**Quantified results:**

- "2,500+ customers"
- "10M+ data points analyzed"
- "$50M+ in revenue tracked"

**Authority signals:**

- Press mentions (Forbes, TechCrunch)
- Certifications (SOC 2, ISO)
- Awards (G2 Leader, Inc 5000)

#### Pain Breakdown Section

Illustrate the **felt experience** of the visitor's problem.

**Not abstract description:**
"Reporting is time-consuming and difficult"

**Emotional specificity:**
"It's 4 PM on Friday. You've spent 3 hours pulling data from 5 different tools. The charts still don't match. Your weekend just vanished."

This is where prospects nod along thinking "YES, that's exactly what I feel."

#### Offer Stack (Value Stacking)

Instead of one deliverable, present components that each deliver value:

```
What You Get:

✓ Automated Dashboard Builder
  Save 15 hours/week on manual reports

✓ 50+ Pre-Built Templates
  Deploy analytics in under 5 minutes

✓ Slack Alerts for Key Metrics
  Never miss a spike or drop

✓ API Access for Custom Integration
  Connect your entire stack

✓ Priority Support (< 2-hour response)
  Get unstuck instantly

✓ Lifetime Feature Updates
  Always get the latest capabilities
```

Each item = specific benefit + quantified value

#### Timing & Scarcity

Position the timeline concretely to reduce **perceived delay**:

**Weak:** "Sign up today"
**Strong:** "Join before Jan 15 to start in Q1"

**Legitimate scarcity:**

- Cohort-based: "Next cohort starts Feb 1 (10 spots left)"
- Seasonal: "Black Friday pricing ends Monday"
- Limited capacity: "We onboard 5 new clients/month"

**Don't fake it:** False scarcity destroys trust permanently.

## Copy Techniques

### Direct, No-Fluff Hooks

**Use very specific benefits:**

- Not: "Grow your business"
- Yes: "Add $50K MRR in 90 days"

**Avoid generic claims:**

- "Best," "top," "great," "amazing" = meaningless without proof
- "Leading" = everyone claims it
- "Revolutionary" = overused and vague

**Short hooks with numbers or concrete contrasts:**

- "10x your content output"
- "Cut support costs 50%"
- "$100K to $1M in 12 months"

### Speak in Client Language

**Talk about the exact pains and desires your audience uses themselves.**

**Don't use jargon:**

- "Leverage our synergistic ecosystem"
- "Paradigm-shifting innovation"
- "Next-generation platform"

**Do use their words (from VOC):**

- "I'm drowning in support tickets" → Use "drowning" in copy
- "I just want it to work" → Use "just works" in positioning
- "Spending my weekends catching up" → Reference weekends

This feels like someone finally **gets them**.

### Objection Pre-Handling

Address objections **before** they become reasons to leave.

**Common objections:**

**"Too expensive"**
→ Show ROI: "Pays for itself in < 30 days"
→ Compare to alternatives: "Replace $5K/month agency"

**"Too complicated"**
→ Speed to value: "5-minute setup"
→ Support: "We handle migration for you"

**"Not sure it'll work for me"**
→ Guarantee: "60-day money-back, no questions"
→ Proof: "Works for companies like yours"

**"Not ready right now"**
→ Loss aversion: "Every day costs you $X"
→ Trial: "Start free, upgrade when ready"

### The Slippery Slide

Each element of your page should naturally lead to the next:

```
Headline → intrigues
Subhead → clarifies
Problem → resonates
Solution → relieves
How it works → demystifies
Social proof → convinces
Offer → excites
Guarantee → removes risk
CTA → closes
```

No dead ends. Every section flows into the next like a **well-designed slide**.

## Conversion Mindset

Professionals think in systems, not tactics.

### Key Questions

1. **What belief must change for a user to act?**
   - From: "This is too expensive"
   - To: "This pays for itself immediately"

2. **What proof supports that belief shift?**
   - ROI calculator
   - Case study showing 10x return
   - Money-back guarantee

3. **What friction exists in the journey?**
   - Long signup form
   - Unclear pricing
   - No human support option

4. **What signals show trust and safety?**
   - Security badges
   - Customer logos
   - Transparent pricing
   - Real testimonials

5. **What story are we telling?**
   - Hero's journey: Struggle → Discovery → Transformation
   - Not: "We have a product"
   - Yes: "We help people like you overcome X"

And then they **test reality**. Because reality always has a punchline.

## Message Testing Framework

### 5-Second Test

Show the page for 5 seconds. Can they answer:

- What is this?
- Who is it for?
- What's the main benefit?

If not, hero section fails.

### Mom Test

Ask 10 target customers (not your mom):

- "What does this page sell?" (clarity test)
- "Who do you think this is for?" (targeting test)
- "Would you click the CTA? Why or why not?" (motivation test)

Don't ask: "Do you like this?" (opinion is worthless)

### Before-After Comparison

**Before messaging:**

- Conversion rate: 1.2%
- Avg time on page: 28 seconds
- Bounce rate: 74%

**After messaging:**

- Conversion rate: 2.8%
- Avg time on page: 51 seconds
- Bounce rate: 61%

Numbers don't lie. Trust the data.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Writing for yourself, not the customer

**Fix:** Use VOC verbatim. Copy their words.

### 2. Being clever instead of clear

**Fix:** If your mom doesn't get it in 3 seconds, it's too clever.

### 3. Listing features without benefits

**Fix:** Feature → So what? → Benefit. Repeat for every feature.

### 4. No proof to back claims

**Fix:** Every claim needs evidence (testimonial, case study, data).

### 5. Too many CTAs

**Fix:** One primary CTA per section. Guide, don't confuse.

### 6. Writing without research

**Fix:** Do VOC first. Always. No exceptions.

### 7. Not testing

**Fix:** Form hypothesis, A/B test, measure, learn.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Copy is offer articulation.** If your offer isn't genuinely compelling under the value equation, no words will fix it.

2. **Emotional specificity and pain narrative kill generic language.** Make them feel it before you sell it.

3. **Headlines carry massive conversion weight.** Treat them as the first hypothesis to test.

4. **Use the value equation as a heuristic:** Make value feel greater than cost on every element.

5. **Speak their language.** Harvest copy from customers, don't invent it.

6. **Test everything.** Intuition is not a strategy.

7. **Document learnings.** Build institutional knowledge, not goldfish memory.
