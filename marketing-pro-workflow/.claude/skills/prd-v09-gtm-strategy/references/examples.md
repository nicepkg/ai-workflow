# GTM Strategy Examples

**Purpose**: Good and bad patterns for go-to-market strategies with real-world examples and lessons.

---

## Good Example 1: Superhuman - Stealth to Premium Launch

### Context

- **Product**: Email client ($30/month, premium positioning)
- **Market**: Crowded (Gmail, Outlook dominant)
- **Strategy**: Stealth → Invite-only → Curated onboarding → Public launch

---

### GTM Execution

**Phase 1: Stealth (2016-2017)**
- Invite-only, no public signup
- Hand-picked first 1,000 users (executives, influencers)
- Each user gets 5 invites
- Waitlist grows to 100,000+

**Phase 2: Onboarding Theater (2017-2019)**
- Personal onboarding session (30 min with team member)
- Ensure setup, teach shortcuts, customize
- NPS > 60 before expanding invites
- "Concierge" experience at scale

**Phase 3: Public Launch (2019)**
- Open to everyone (remove waitlist)
- Messaging: "100,000 people waited, now you can join"
- Price: $30/month (premium positioning)
- Social proof: Execs at Uber, Facebook, Dropbox

---

### Why This Worked

✅ **Built mystique**: 3-year waitlist created FOMO
✅ **Ensured quality**: Every user onboarded personally
✅ **High NPS → Word of mouth**: Users became evangelists
✅ **Premium positioning**: $30/month justified by exclusivity + quality
✅ **Patient capital**: Took time to get product right before scaling

---

### Key Metrics

- **Waitlist**: 0 → 100,000 in 3 years (organic)
- **NPS**: 60+ (extremely high for software)
- **Retention**: 70%+ monthly active
- **CAC**: ~$0 (waitlist + word of mouth)
- **ARPU**: $360/year (premium pricing)

---

### Lessons

**Applicable When**:
- Premium product (can afford slow growth)
- Quality differentiation (need time to perfect)
- Network effects (each user invites others)

**Not Applicable When**:
- Need revenue quickly
- Low-margin product (can't afford slow burn)
- Competitors moving fast (land grab)

---

## Good Example 2: Notion - Relaunch After Pivot

### Context

- **Original Product** (2016): Consumer note-taking app
- **Problem**: Didn't resonate, low growth
- **Pivot** (2018): Team workspace, all-in-one tool
- **Strategy**: Relaunch with new positioning

---

### GTM Execution

**Phase 1: Honest Post-Mortem (2018)**
- Founder blog post: "We built the wrong thing"
- Transparent about failure
- Shared learnings, new vision
- Invited feedback on new direction

**Phase 2: Beta with Previous Users (2018)**
- Reached out to churned users
- "We listened, here's what we built"
- Personal emails, video demos
- 30% of churned users returned

**Phase 3: Product Hunt Relaunch (2018)**
- "Notion 2.0" positioning
- Angle: Comeback story
- #1 Product of the Day
- 5,000 signups in 24 hours

**Phase 4: Community Building (2019-2020)**
- YouTube tutorials (Notion community created)
- Reddit r/Notion grew to 100k members
- User-generated templates
- Ambassador program (power users)

**Phase 5: Viral Growth (2020-2021)**
- Word of mouth driven by YouTube, TikTok
- Students → Startups → Enterprise
- Free tier with generous limits
- Network effects (shared docs)

---

### Why This Worked

✅ **Owned the failure**: Transparency built trust
✅ **Listened to users**: Pivot based on feedback
✅ **Nailed positioning**: "All-in-one workspace" clearer than "note-taking"
✅ **Community-led growth**: Users created content, templates
✅ **Generous free tier**: Students spread to workplaces
✅ **Patience**: Took 2 years to relaunch, but got it right

---

### Key Metrics

- **2018 (Pre-relaunch)**: 10,000 users, flat growth
- **2019 (Post-relaunch)**: 100,000 users
- **2020**: 4 million users
- **2021**: 20 million users
- **Valuation**: $10B (2021)

---

### Lessons

**Applicable When**:
- Previous launch failed (own it, pivot)
- Product-market fit unclear (iterate until you find it)
- Community potential (users will create content)

**Not Applicable When**:
- First launch (no failure to recover from)
- Burned bridges (users won't give second chance)
- Time-sensitive (relaunch takes time)

---

## Good Example 3: Linear - Clone with Premium Positioning

### Context

- **Product**: Project management (Jira alternative)
- **Market**: Crowded (Jira, Asana, Monday dominant)
- **Strategy**: "Better Jira for fast-moving teams"
- **Product Type**: Clone (but positioned as premium)

---

### GTM Execution

**Phase 1: Invite-Only Beta (2019-2020)**
- Target: YC companies, tech startups
- Invite-only for 9 months
- Focused on speed, design, opinionated workflow
- Built waitlist of 10,000

**Phase 2: Public Launch (2020)**
- Launched on Product Hunt
- #1 Product of the Day
- Messaging: "Jira, but fast and delightful"
- Price: $8/user/month (between Jira free and Jira premium)

**Phase 3: Word of Mouth Growth (2020-2021)**
- Developer Twitter buzz
- "Switching to Linear" threads
- Comparison blog: "Linear vs Jira"
- SEO: Rank for "Jira alternative"

**Phase 4: Enterprise Expansion (2022-2023)**
- Add enterprise features (SSO, SAML)
- Move upmarket (Vercel, Ramp, Retool using Linear)
- Raise prices (now $10/user)
- Still maintain speed/design differentiation

---

### Why This Worked

✅ **Clear differentiation**: "Fast and delightful" vs "Slow and complex" (Jira)
✅ **Opinionated**: Less customization = easier to use
✅ **Developer love**: Built for developers, by developers
✅ **Timing**: Remote work boom (2020) increased demand for tools
✅ **Word of mouth**: Users voluntarily shared "I switched to Linear" stories

---

### Key Metrics

- **2020 (Launch)**: 1,000 teams
- **2021**: 5,000 teams
- **2023**: 10,000+ teams
- **ARR**: ~$50M+ (estimated)
- **Valuation**: $1.6B (2023)

---

### Lessons

**Applicable When**:
- Clone strategy (improve on incumbent)
- Developer audience (strong opinions, vocal)
- Differentiation on experience (not features)

**Not Applicable When**:
- Need feature parity (Linear has FEWER features than Jira)
- Broad market (Linear targets tech teams)
- Low-touch sales (Linear benefits from word of mouth)

---

## Bad Example 1: Quibi - Big Bang with Wrong Audience

### Context

- **Product**: Short-form video streaming ($5-8/month)
- **Market**: Crowded (YouTube, TikTok free)
- **Strategy**: Big bang launch with celebrity content
- **Result**: Shut down after 6 months

---

### GTM Execution

**Phase 1: Big Budget Launch (April 2020)**
- Raised $1.75 billion before launch
- Hired Hollywood talent (expensive content)
- Super Bowl ad ($5M+)
- PR blitz (TechCrunch, Variety, etc.)
- Launched to everyone at once

**Launch Month Results**:
- 1.7M downloads (Day 1)
- 90-day free trial offered
- Retention: 8% after free trial (terrible)

**Shutdown** (December 2020):
- Couldn't find product-market fit
- Users didn't want to pay for short video (YouTube, TikTok free)
- Content didn't resonate
- Burned $1B+ in 6 months

---

### Why This Failed

❌ **Skipped validation**: Big bang without beta/soft launch
❌ **Wrong audience**: Positioned for commuters (launched during COVID lockdown)
❌ **Paid vs Free**: Competed with free (TikTok, YouTube)
❌ **Content mismatch**: Hollywood talent for Gen Z (didn't resonate)
❌ **No feedback loop**: Burned budget before learning

---

### Lessons

**What to Avoid**:
- Big bang without validation
- Compete with free
- Ignore market timing (COVID killed "mobile-first" positioning)
- Over-invest before product-market fit

**What to Do Instead**:
- Soft launch (test with 1,000 users first)
- Differentiate (not "short video" - TikTok won that)
- Listen to users (pivot if feedback negative)

---

## Bad Example 2: Google+ - Feature Dump Marketing

### Context

- **Product**: Social network (Facebook competitor)
- **Market**: Facebook dominant (800M users)
- **Strategy**: "Facebook, but with better privacy + Google integration"
- **Result**: Shut down after 8 years, low engagement

---

### GTM Execution

**Phase 1: Invite-Only Beta (2011)**
- Invite-only for 3 months (like Gmail)
- Built hype, waitlist of millions
- Press coverage ("Facebook killer")

**Phase 2: Public Launch (2011)**
- Opened to everyone
- Integrated into all Google products (Gmail, YouTube, Search)
- Forced users to create profile (bundling)

**Messaging Problems**:
- "Circles" (organize friends by group)
- "Hangouts" (video chat)
- "Sparks" (content discovery)
- → **Too many features, no clear value prop**

**Result**:
- 300M signups (forced by Google bundling)
- 9 minute average session (vs 6 hours on Facebook)
- Ghost town (signups but no engagement)
- Shut down 2019

---

### Why This Failed

❌ **Feature dump messaging**: "We have Circles and Hangouts and Sparks..."
❌ **No switching reason**: Why leave Facebook? (friends already there)
❌ **Forced adoption**: Inflated signup numbers, not real users
❌ **Late to market**: Facebook already had network effects

---

### Lessons

**What to Avoid**:
- List features without clear benefit
- Force users to adopt (inflates vanity metrics)
- Compete with strong network effects (without 10x better)

**What to Do Instead**:
- Lead with ONE benefit ("Best video calls" not "social network with video")
- Unbundle (Hangouts should have been standalone, not part of social network)
- Niche first (target specific community, then expand)

---

## Bad Example 3: Juicero - PR Over Product

### Context

- **Product**: $400 WiFi-connected juicer
- **Market**: Juice at home
- **Strategy**: Premium positioning, investor/press hype
- **Result**: Shut down after 16 months

---

### GTM Execution

**Phase 1: Investor Hype (2016)**
- Raised $120M from Google Ventures, Kleiner Perkins
- "Keurig for juice" positioning
- Press: "Revolutionary" (Bloomberg, TechCrunch)

**Phase 2: Launch (2016)**
- $400 price point (later $200)
- Subscription juice packs ($5-8 per pack)
- WiFi-connected (tracks juice freshness)

**Phase 3: Viral Failure (2017)**
- Bloomberg video: "You can squeeze packs by hand" (no $400 machine needed)
- Ridicule on Twitter, late-night shows
- Sales collapsed

**Shutdown** (2017):
- Burned $120M in 16 months
- Could not recover from negative PR

---

### Why This Failed

❌ **Product didn't justify price**: $400 machine for $8 juice
❌ **Over-engineered**: WiFi-connected juicer (unnecessary)
❌ **PR backfired**: "Squeeze by hand" video killed brand
❌ **Ignored customer feedback**: Price too high, value unclear

---

### Lessons

**What to Avoid**:
- Raise too much before validation (inflates expectations)
- Price based on cost (engineers' view) not value (customer view)
- Over-engineer (WiFi-connected juicer)
- Ignore negative feedback ("They don't get it" → they do, product is bad)

**What to Do Instead**:
- Validate demand BEFORE raising big round
- Price based on value (what would you pay?)
- Simplify (remove unnecessary features)
- Listen to criticism (pivot or kill product)

---

## Good Pattern Summary

### GTM Strategy Checklist

A good GTM strategy has:

- [x] **Clear positioning** (one-sentence "what we do for whom")
- [x] **Differentiation** (why us vs alternatives - specific, defensible)
- [x] **Validation** (beta/soft launch before big bang)
- [x] **Appropriate channel** (matches audience, budget, product type)
- [x] **Realistic timeline** (phases, not all-at-once)
- [x] **Metrics-driven** (know success criteria, measure weekly)
- [x] **Feedback loop** (iterate based on user response)
- [x] **Launch → Learn → Iterate** (not Launch → Hope)
