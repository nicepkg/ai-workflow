- If CAC $20-100: Paid social, partnerships
- If CAC $100-500: Paid search, influencers
- If CAC > $500: Sales, enterprise

---

## Channel Testing Framework

### Week 1-2: Test 3 Channels

- Channel C: $500

**Measure**:
- Signups per channel
- CAC per channel
- Quality (activation rate)

---

### Week 3-4: Double Down on Winner

- 2x budget on winner
- Keep testing second-best

**Example Results**:

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Spreading Too Thin

**Problem**: Trying 10 channels with $100 each (not enough signal)

**Fix**: Focus on 2-3 channels with real budget

---

### Mistake 2: Giving Up Too Early

**Problem**: "We tried paid search for 1 week, didn't work"

**Fix**: Run for 4-6 weeks, iterate (landing page, ad copy, keywords)

---

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Owned Channels

**Problem**: Spending $10K on ads, ignoring email list

**Fix**: Always start with owned (email, in-app), then paid

---

### Mistake 4: No Attribution

**Problem**: Don't know which channel drove signups

**Fix**: Use UTM codes, track source in database
