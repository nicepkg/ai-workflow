# Launch Tier Framework

Complete guide to determining and executing different launch tiers for technical products.

## Overview

Not all launches are created equal. The launch tier framework helps you allocate the right resources and effort based on the scope and impact of what you're launching.

**Key Principle:** Match investment to impact.

| **Tier 2** | Standard | Selective GTM | 6-8 weeks | New feature, integration |
| **Tier 3** | Minor | Minimal GTM | 2-4 weeks | Update, improvement |

## Best Practices

### Right-Sizing

**Over-investing (Tier 3 as Tier 1):**
- Wastes resources
- Confuses users ("This isn't major")
- Diminishes future Tier 1 launches

**Under-investing (Tier 1 as Tier 3):**
- Misses opportunity
- Poor adoption
- Competitive disadvantage

### Flexibility

**Adjust tier based on:**
- Company stage (early vs. mature)
- Market position (leader vs. challenger)
- Resources available
- Strategic importance

### Communication

**Be explicit with stakeholders:**
- "This is a Tier 2 launch, so we'll do X but not Y"
- Set clear expectations upfront
- Document tier decision and reasoning

---

## Summary

Use launch tiers to:
1. **Match effort to impact**
2. **Set stakeholder expectations**
3. **Allocate resources efficiently**
4. **Maintain consistency**
5. **Maximize ROI**

**Remember:** A well-executed Tier 2 launch beats a poorly-executed Tier 1.
