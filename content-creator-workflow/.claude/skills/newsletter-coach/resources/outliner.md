# Outliner

Your job is to write 4-8 skimmable, sentence-style subheads that deliver the full value of the post - no body copy needed.

Each subhead should:
- Be written in full sentence form
- Be specific, valuable, and easy to skim
- Follow the logic and format of the post type (steps, tips, mistakes, lessons, benefits, examples)

Start with:

Headline: [INSERT HEADLINE]
Post Type: [Steps / Tips / Mistakes / Lessons / Benefits / Examples / Reasons / Questions / Case Study / Story]

Then return:

Main Points:
1. [first subhead]
2. [second subhead]

## Post Type Formats

### 1. HOW-TO / STEPS
- Use "Step #1: [command]" format
- Focus on clarity, action, and order

### 2. TIPS
- Each subhead is a standalone takeaway
- Use "Tip #1: [lesson or recommendation]" format
- Be specific and useful
- Example: *Tip #1: Ask ChatGPT to mimic your voice using past content*

### 3. MISTAKES
- Each subhead highlights a common error
- Use "Mistake #1: [error]" format
- Add a short fix or insight if possible
- Example: *Mistake #1: Asking for 30 posts without showing what works first*

### 4. LESSONS
- Each subhead reveals something learned (often with a story)
- Use "Lesson #1: [insight]" format
- Focus on counterintuitive or surprising truths
- Example: *Lesson #1: Writing faster doesn't mean writing worse*

### 5. REASONS / BENEFITS
- Each subhead is a persuasive point
- Use "Reason #1: [benefit]" or "Benefit #1: [advantage]"
- Be clear and concrete
- Example: *Reason #1: You'll never run out of content ideas again*

### 6. EXAMPLES
- Each subhead introduces a different example
- Use "Example #1: [specific scenario]" format

### 7. QUESTIONS
- Each subhead poses a different question
- Use "Question #1: [specific question]" format
- Highlight different angles, objections, or misconceptions

### 8. CASE STUDY
- Focus on one detailed case study broken into key moments or phases
- Each subhead represents a different part of the journey or key insight from that single case
- Don't use numbered format - make each subhead feel like a chapter in the story
- Focus on the progression, turning points, and lessons from one specific example
- Example: *Charging $25/hour and barely paying rent*

### 9. BENEFITS

- Use "Benefit #1: [advantage]"

### 10. STORY
- Each subhead should read like a compelling story hook or moment
- Focus on specific, relatable situations that draw readers in
- Use narrative language that creates curiosity or connection
- Don't use "Story #1:" format - make each subhead feel like a mini story teaser
- Example: *I thought I had the perfect morning routine until I tracked my energy for 30 days*
- Example: *The client who fired me taught me the most valuable lesson about pricing*
- Example: *My biggest business mistake happened at 2 AM in a Starbucks parking lot*
