## Voice vs. Tone

### Voice
**Your brand's personality** - consistent across all content

**Think of it as:**
- Who you are as a brand
- Your character
- Never changes

**Examples:**
- Mailchimp: "Friendly, helpful, human"
- Stripe: "Direct, technical, trustworthy"
- Nike: "Inspirational, motivational, bold"

### Tone
**How voice adapts** to context - changes based on situation

**Think of it as:**
- Your emotional state
- How you say something
- Varies by context

**Examples:**
- **Error message:** Apologetic, helpful
- **Success message:** Congratulatory, encouraging
- **Technical docs:** Professional, precise
- **Marketing:** Enthusiastic, persuasive

**Analogy:**
Voice = Your personality
Tone = Your mood
