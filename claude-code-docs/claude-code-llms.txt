title: Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock
---

## [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

Before configuring Claude Code with Bedrock, ensure you have:

- An AWS account with Bedrock access enabled
- Access to desired Claude models (for example, Claude Sonnet 4.5) in Bedrock
- AWS CLI installed and configured (optional - only needed if you don’t have another mechanism for getting credentials)
- Appropriate IAM permissions

## [​](#setup) Setup

### [​](#1-submit-use-case-details) 1. Submit use case details

First-time users of Anthropic models are required to submit use case details before invoking a model. This is done once per account.

1. Ensure you have the right IAM permissions (see more on that below)
2. Navigate to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
3. Select **Chat/Text playground**
4. Choose any Anthropic model and you will be prompted to fill out the use case form

### [​](#2-configure-aws-credentials) 2. Configure AWS credentials

Claude Code uses the default AWS SDK credential chain. Set up your credentials using one of these methods:
**Option A: AWS CLI configuration**

```bash
aws configure
```

**Option B: Environment variables (access key)**

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your-session-token
```

**Option C: Environment variables (SSO profile)**

```bash
aws sso login --profile=<your-profile-name>

export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
```

**Option D: AWS Management Console credentials**

```bash
aws login
```

[Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/command-line-sign-in.html) about `aws login`.
**Option E: Bedrock API keys**

```bash
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=your-bedrock-api-key
```

Bedrock API keys provide a simpler authentication method without needing full AWS credentials. [Learn more about Bedrock API keys](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-ai-development-with-amazon-bedrock-api-keys/).

#### [​](#advanced-credential-configuration) Advanced credential configuration

Claude Code supports automatic credential refresh for AWS SSO and corporate identity providers. Add these settings to your Claude Code settings file (see [Settings](/docs/en/settings) for file locations).
When Claude Code detects that your AWS credentials are expired (either locally based on their timestamp or when Bedrock returns a credential error), it will automatically run your configured `awsAuthRefresh` and/or `awsCredentialExport` commands to obtain new credentials before retrying the request.

##### Example configuration

```bash
{
  "awsAuthRefresh": "aws sso login --profile myprofile",
  "env": {
    "AWS_PROFILE": "myprofile"
  }
}
```

##### Configuration settings explained

**`awsAuthRefresh`**: Use this for commands that modify the `.aws` directory, such as updating credentials, SSO cache, or config files. The command’s output is displayed to the user, but interactive input isn’t supported. This works well for browser-based SSO flows where the CLI displays a URL or code and you complete authentication in the browser.
**`awsCredentialExport`**: Only use this if you can’t modify `.aws` and must directly return credentials. Output is captured silently and not shown to the user. The command must output JSON in this format:

```bash
{
  "Credentials": {
    "AccessKeyId": "value",
    "SecretAccessKey": "value",
    "SessionToken": "value"
  }
}
```

### [​](#3-configure-claude-code) 3. Configure Claude Code

Set the following environment variables to enable Bedrock:

```bash
# Enable Bedrock integration
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1  # or your preferred region

# Optional: Override the region for the small/fast model (Haiku)
export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL_AWS_REGION=us-west-2
```

When enabling Bedrock for Claude Code, keep the following in mind:

- `AWS_REGION` is a required environment variable. Claude Code does not read from the `.aws` config file for this setting.
- When using Bedrock, the `/login` and `/logout` commands are disabled since authentication is handled through AWS credentials.
- You can use settings files for environment variables like `AWS_PROFILE` that you don’t want to leak to other processes. See [Settings](/docs/en/settings) for more information.

### [​](#4-model-configuration) 4. Model configuration

Claude Code uses these default models for Bedrock:

| Model type | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary model | `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0` |
| Small/fast model | `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` |

For Bedrock users, Claude Code won’t automatically upgrade from Haiku 3.5 to Haiku 4.5. To manually switch to a newer Haiku model, set the `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` environment variable to the full model name (for example, `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`).

To customize models, use one of these methods:

```bash
# Using inference profile ID
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL='global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0'
export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL='us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0'

# Using application inference profile ARN
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL='arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-2:your-account-id:application-inference-profile/your-model-id'

# Optional: Disable prompt caching if needed
export DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1
```

[Prompt caching](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) may not be available in all regions.

### [​](#5-output-token-configuration) 5. Output token configuration

These are the recommended token settings for Claude Code with Amazon Bedrock:

```bash
# Recommended output token settings for Bedrock
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=4096
export MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=1024
```

**Why these values:**

- **`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=4096`**: Bedrock’s burndown throttling logic sets a minimum of 4096 tokens as the `max_token` penalty. Setting this lower won’t reduce costs but may cut off long tool uses, causing the Claude Code agent loop to fail persistently. Claude Code typically uses less than 4096 output tokens without extended thinking, but may need this headroom for tasks involving significant file creation or Write tool usage.
- **`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=1024`**: This provides space for extended thinking without cutting off tool use responses, while still maintaining focused reasoning chains. This balance helps prevent trajectory changes that aren’t always helpful for coding tasks specifically.

## [​](#iam-configuration) IAM configuration

Create an IAM policy with the required permissions for Claude Code:

```bash
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowModelAndInferenceProfileAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream",
        "bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:inference-profile/*",
        "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:application-inference-profile/*",
        "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:foundation-model/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowMarketplaceSubscription",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions",
        "aws-marketplace:Subscribe"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:CalledViaLast": "bedrock.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For more restrictive permissions, you can limit the Resource to specific inference profile ARNs.
For details, see [Bedrock IAM documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/security-iam.html).

We recommend creating a dedicated AWS account for Claude Code to simplify cost tracking and access control.

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

If you encounter region issues:

- Check model availability: `aws bedrock list-inference-profiles --region your-region`
- Switch to a supported region: `export AWS_REGION=us-east-1`
- Consider using inference profiles for cross-region access

If you receive an error “on-demand throughput isn’t supported”:

- Specify the model as an [inference profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html) ID

Claude Code uses the Bedrock [Invoke API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModelWithResponseStream.html) and does not support the Converse API.

title: Checkpointing
---

Claude Code automatically tracks Claude’s file edits as you work, allowing you to quickly undo changes and rewind to previous states if anything gets off track.

## [​](#how-checkpoints-work) How checkpoints work

As you work with Claude, checkpointing automatically captures the state of your code before each edit. This safety net lets you pursue ambitious, wide-scale tasks knowing you can always return to a prior code state.

### [​](#automatic-tracking) Automatic tracking

Claude Code tracks all changes made by its file editing tools:

- Every user prompt creates a new checkpoint
- Checkpoints persist across sessions, so you can access them in resumed conversations
- Automatically cleaned up along with sessions after 30 days (configurable)

### [​](#rewinding-changes) Rewinding changes

Press `Esc` twice (`Esc` + `Esc`) or use the `/rewind` command to open up the rewind menu. You can choose to restore:

- **Conversation only**: Rewind to a user message while keeping code changes
- **Code only**: Revert file changes while keeping the conversation
- **Both code and conversation**: Restore both to a prior point in the session

## [​](#common-use-cases) Common use cases

Checkpoints are particularly useful when:

- **Exploring alternatives**: Try different implementation approaches without losing your starting point
- **Recovering from mistakes**: Quickly undo changes that introduced bugs or broke functionality
- **Iterating on features**: Experiment with variations knowing you can revert to working states

## [​](#limitations) Limitations

### [​](#bash-command-changes-not-tracked) Bash command changes not tracked

Checkpointing does not track files modified by bash commands. For example, if Claude Code runs:

```bash
rm file.txt
mv old.txt new.txt
cp source.txt dest.txt
```

These file modifications cannot be undone through rewind. Only direct file edits made through Claude’s file editing tools are tracked.

### [​](#external-changes-not-tracked) External changes not tracked

Checkpointing only tracks files that have been edited within the current session. Manual changes you make to files outside of Claude Code and edits from other concurrent sessions are normally not captured, unless they happen to modify the same files as the current session.

### [​](#not-a-replacement-for-version-control) Not a replacement for version control

Checkpoints are designed for quick, session-level recovery. For permanent version history and collaboration:

- Continue using version control (ex. Git) for commits, branches, and long-term history
- Checkpoints complement but don’t replace proper version control
- Think of checkpoints as “local undo” and Git as “permanent history”

source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome
title: Use Claude Code with Chrome (beta)
---

Chrome integration is in beta and currently works with Google Chrome only. It is not yet supported on Brave, Arc, or other Chromium-based browsers. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is also not supported.

Claude Code integrates with the Claude in Chrome browser extension to give you browser automation capabilities directly from your terminal. Build in your terminal, then test and debug in your browser without switching contexts.

## [​](#what-the-integration-enables) What the integration enables

With Chrome connected, you can chain browser actions with terminal commands in a single workflow. For example: scrape documentation from a website, analyze it, generate code based on what you learned, and commit the result.
Key capabilities include:

- **Live debugging**: Claude reads console errors and DOM state directly, then fixes the code that caused them
- **Design verification**: Build a UI from a Figma mock, then have Claude open it in the browser and verify it matches
- **Web app testing**: Test form validation, check for visual regressions, or verify user flows work correctly
- **Authenticated web apps**: Interact with Google Docs, Gmail, Notion, or any app you’re logged into without needing API connectors
- **Data extraction**: Pull structured information from web pages and save it locally
- **Task automation**: Automate repetitive browser tasks like data entry, form filling, or multi-site workflows
- **Session recording**: Record browser interactions as GIFs to document or share what happened

## [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

Before using Claude Code with Chrome, you need:

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser
- [Claude in Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude/fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn) version 1.0.36 or higher
- [Claude Code CLI](/docs/en/quickstart#step-1:-install-claude-code) version 2.0.73 or higher
- A paid Claude plan (Pro, Team, or Enterprise)

## [​](#how-the-integration-works) How the integration works

Claude Code communicates with Chrome through the Claude in Chrome browser extension. The extension uses Chrome’s [Native Messaging API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging) to receive commands from Claude Code and execute them in your browser. This architecture lets Claude Code control browser tabs, read page content, and perform actions while you continue working in your terminal.
When Claude encounters a login page, CAPTCHA, or other blocker, it pauses and asks you to handle it. You can provide credentials for Claude to enter, or log in manually in the browser. Once you’re past the blocker, tell Claude to continue and it picks up where it left off.
Claude opens new tabs for browser tasks rather than taking over existing ones. However, it shares your browser’s login state, so if you’re already signed into a site in Chrome, Claude can access it without re-authenticating.

The Chrome integration requires a visible browser window. When Claude performs browser actions, you’ll see Chrome open and navigate in real time. There’s no headless mode since the integration relies on your actual browser session with its login state.

## [​](#set-up-the-integration) Set up the integration

1

Update Claude Code

Chrome integration requires a recent version of Claude Code. If you installed using the [native installer](/docs/en/quickstart#step-1:-install-claude-code), updates happen automatically. Otherwise, run:

```bash
claude update
```

2

Start Claude Code with Chrome enabled

Launch Claude Code with the `--chrome` flag:

```bash
claude --chrome
```

3

Verify the connection

Run `/chrome` to check the connection status and manage settings. If the extension isn’t detected, you’ll see a warning with a link to install it.

You can also enable Chrome integration from within an existing session using the `/chrome` slash command.

## [​](#try-it-out) Try it out

Once connected, type this into Claude to see the integration in action:

```bash
Go to code.claude.com/docs, click on the search box,
type "hooks", and tell me what results appear
```

Claude opens the page, clicks into the search field, types the query, and reports the autocomplete results. This shows navigation, clicking, and typing in a single workflow.

## [​](#example-workflows) Example workflows

Claude can navigate pages, click and type, fill forms, scroll, read console logs and network requests, manage tabs, resize windows, and record GIFs. Run `/mcp` and click into `claude-in-chrome` to see the full list of available tools.
The following examples show common patterns for browser automation.

### [​](#test-a-local-web-application) Test a local web application

When developing a web app, ask Claude to verify your changes work correctly:

```bash
I just updated the login form validation. Can you open localhost:3000,
try submitting the form with invalid data, and check if the error
messages appear correctly?
```

Claude navigates to your local server, interacts with the form, and reports what it observes.

### [​](#debug-with-console-logs) Debug with console logs

If your app has issues, Claude can read console output to help diagnose problems:

```bash
Open the dashboard page and check the console for any errors when
the page loads.
```

Claude reads the console messages and can filter for specific patterns or error types.

### [​](#automate-form-filling) Automate form filling

Speed up repetitive data entry tasks:

```bash
I have a spreadsheet of customer contacts in contacts.csv. For each row,
go to our CRM at crm.example.com, click "Add Contact", and fill in the
name, email, and phone fields.
```

Claude reads your local file, navigates the web interface, and enters the data for each record.

### [​](#draft-content-in-google-docs) Draft content in Google Docs

Use Claude to write directly in your documents without API setup:

```bash
Draft a project update based on our recent commits and add it to my
Google Doc at docs.google.com/document/d/abc123
```

Claude opens the document, clicks into the editor, and types the content. This works with any web app you’re logged into: Gmail, Notion, Sheets, and more.

### [​](#extract-data-from-web-pages) Extract data from web pages

Pull structured information from websites:

```bash
Go to the product listings page and extract the name, price, and
availability for each item. Save the results as a CSV file.
```

Claude navigates to the page, reads the content, and compiles the data into a structured format.

### [​](#run-multi-site-workflows) Run multi-site workflows

Coordinate tasks across multiple websites:

```bash
Check my calendar for meetings tomorrow, then for each meeting with
an external attendee, look up their company on LinkedIn and add a
note about what they do.
```

Claude works across tabs to gather information and complete the workflow.

### [​](#record-a-demo-gif) Record a demo GIF

Create shareable recordings of browser interactions:

```bash
Record a GIF showing how to complete the checkout flow, from adding
an item to the cart through to the confirmation page.
```

Claude records the interaction sequence and saves it as a GIF file.

## [​](#best-practices) Best practices

When using browser automation, keep these guidelines in mind:

- **Modal dialogs can interrupt the flow**: JavaScript alerts, confirms, and prompts block browser events and prevent Claude from receiving commands. If a dialog appears, dismiss it manually and tell Claude to continue.
- **Use fresh tabs**: Claude creates new tabs for each session. If a tab becomes unresponsive, ask Claude to create a new one.
- **Filter console output**: Console logs can be verbose. When debugging, tell Claude what patterns to look for rather than asking for all console output.

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

### [​](#extension-not-detected) Extension not detected

If Claude Code shows “Chrome extension not detected”:

1. Verify the Chrome extension (version 1.0.36 or higher) is installed
2. Verify Claude Code is version 2.0.73 or higher by running `claude --version`
3. Check that Chrome is running
4. Run `/chrome` and select “Reconnect extension” to re-establish the connection
5. If the issue persists, restart both Claude Code and Chrome

### [​](#browser-not-responding) Browser not responding

If Claude’s browser commands stop working:

1. Check if a modal dialog (alert, confirm, prompt) is blocking the page
2. Ask Claude to create a new tab and try again
3. Restart the Chrome extension by disabling and re-enabling it

### [​](#first-time-setup) First-time setup

The first time you use the integration, Claude Code installs a native messaging host that allows communication between the CLI and Chrome. If you encounter permission errors, you may need to restart Chrome for the installation to take effect.

## [​](#enable-by-default) Enable by default

Chrome integration requires the `--chrome` flag each time you start Claude Code. To enable it by default, run `/chrome` and select “Enabled by default”.

Enabling Chrome by default increases context usage since browser tools are always loaded. If you notice increased context consumption, disable this setting and use `--chrome` only when needed.

Site-level permissions are inherited from the Chrome extension. Manage permissions in the Chrome extension settings to control which sites Claude can browse, click, and type on. Run `/chrome` to see current permission settings.

Claude Code on the web is currently in research preview.

## [​](#what-is-claude-code-on-the-web) What is Claude Code on the web?

Claude Code on the web lets developers kick off Claude Code from the Claude app. This is perfect for:

- **Answering questions**: Ask about code architecture and how features are implemented
- **Bug fixes and routine tasks**: Well-defined tasks that don’t require frequent steering
- **Parallel work**: Tackle multiple bug fixes in parallel
- **Repositories not on your local machine**: Work on code you don’t have checked out locally
- **Backend changes**: Where Claude Code can write tests and then write code to pass those tests

Claude Code is also available on the Claude iOS app for kicking off tasks on the go and monitoring work in progress.
You can move between local and remote development: [send tasks from your terminal to run on the web](#from-terminal-to-web) with the `&` prefix, or [teleport web sessions back to your terminal](#from-web-to-terminal) to continue locally.

## [​](#who-can-use-claude-code-on-the-web) Who can use Claude Code on the web?

Claude Code on the web is available in research preview to:

- **Pro users**
- **Max users**
- **Team premium seat users**
- **Enterprise premium seat users**

## [​](#getting-started) Getting started

1. Visit [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Install the Claude GitHub app in your repositories
4. Select your default environment
5. Submit your coding task
6. Review changes and create a pull request in GitHub

## [​](#how-it-works) How it works

When you start a task on Claude Code on the web:

1. **Repository cloning**: Your repository is cloned to an Anthropic-managed virtual machine
2. **Environment setup**: Claude prepares a secure cloud environment with your code
3. **Network configuration**: Internet access is configured based on your settings
4. **Task execution**: Claude analyzes code, makes changes, runs tests, and checks its work
5. **Completion**: You’re notified when finished and can create a PR with the changes
6. **Results**: Changes are pushed to a branch, ready for pull request creation

## [​](#moving-tasks-between-web-and-terminal) Moving tasks between web and terminal

You can start tasks on the web and continue them in your terminal, or send tasks from your terminal to run on the web. Web sessions persist even if you close your laptop, and you can monitor them from anywhere including the Claude iOS app.

Session handoff is one-way: you can pull web sessions into your terminal, but you can’t push an existing terminal session to the web. The [`&` prefix](#from-terminal-to-web) creates a *new* web session with your current conversation context.

### [​](#from-terminal-to-web) From terminal to web

Start a message with `&` inside Claude Code to send a task to run on the web:

```bash
& Fix the authentication bug in src/auth/login.ts
```

This creates a new web session on claude.ai with your current conversation context. The task runs in the cloud while you continue working locally. Use `/tasks` to check progress, or open the session on claude.ai or the Claude iOS app to interact directly. From there you can steer Claude, provide feedback, or answer questions just like any other conversation.
You can also start a web session directly from the command line:

```bash
claude --remote "Fix the authentication bug in src/auth/login.ts"
```

#### [​](#tips-for-background-tasks) Tips for background tasks

**Plan locally, execute remotely**: For complex tasks, start Claude in plan mode to collaborate on the approach before sending work to the web:

```bash
claude --permission-mode plan
```

In plan mode, Claude can only read files and explore the codebase. Once you’re satisfied with the plan, send it to the web for autonomous execution:

```bash
& Execute the migration plan we discussed
```

This pattern gives you control over the strategy while letting Claude execute autonomously in the cloud.
**Run tasks in parallel**: Each `&` command creates its own web session that runs independently. You can kick off multiple tasks and they’ll all run simultaneously in separate sessions:

```bash
& Fix the flaky test in auth.spec.ts
& Update the API documentation
& Refactor the logger to use structured output
```

Monitor all sessions with `/tasks`. When a session completes, you can create a PR from the web interface or [teleport](#from-web-to-terminal) the session to your terminal to continue working.

### [​](#from-web-to-terminal) From web to terminal

There are several ways to pull a web session into your terminal:

- **Using `/teleport`**: From within Claude Code, run `/teleport` (or `/tp`) to see an interactive picker of your web sessions. If you have uncommitted changes, you’ll be prompted to stash them first.
- **Using `--teleport`**: From the command line, run `claude --teleport` for an interactive session picker, or `claude --teleport <session-id>` to resume a specific session directly.
- **From `/tasks`**: Run `/tasks` to see your background sessions, then press `t` to teleport into one
- **From the web interface**: Click “Open in CLI” to copy a command you can paste into your terminal

When you teleport a session, Claude verifies you’re in the correct repository, fetches and checks out the branch from the remote session, and loads the full conversation history into your terminal.

#### [​](#requirements-for-teleporting) Requirements for teleporting

Teleport checks these requirements before resuming a session. If any requirement isn’t met, you’ll see an error or be prompted to resolve the issue.

| Requirement | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Clean git state | Your working directory must have no uncommitted changes. Teleport prompts you to stash changes if needed. |
| Correct repository | You must run `--teleport` from a checkout of the same repository, not a fork. |
| Branch available | The branch from the web session must have been pushed to the remote. Teleport automatically fetches and checks it out. |
| Same account | You must be authenticated to the same Claude.ai account used in the web session. |

## [​](#cloud-environment) Cloud environment

### [​](#default-image) Default image

We build and maintain a universal image with common toolchains and language ecosystems pre-installed. This image includes:

- Popular programming languages and runtimes
- Common build tools and package managers
- Testing frameworks and linters

#### [​](#checking-available-tools) Checking available tools

To see what’s pre-installed in your environment, ask Claude Code to run:

```bash
check-tools
```

This command displays:

- Programming languages and their versions
- Available package managers
- Installed development tools

#### [​](#language-specific-setups) Language-specific setups

The universal image includes pre-configured environments for:

- **Python**: Python 3.x with pip, poetry, and common scientific libraries
- **Node.js**: Latest LTS versions with npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun
- **Ruby**: Versions 3.1.6, 3.2.6, 3.3.6 (default: 3.3.6) with gem, bundler, and rbenv for version management
- **PHP**: Version 8.4.14
- **Java**: OpenJDK with Maven and Gradle
- **Go**: Latest stable version with module support
- **Rust**: Rust toolchain with cargo
- **C++**: GCC and Clang compilers

#### [​](#databases) Databases

The universal image includes the following databases:

- **PostgreSQL**: Version 16
- **Redis**: Version 7.0

### [​](#environment-configuration) Environment configuration

When you start a session in Claude Code on the web, here’s what happens under the hood:

1. **Environment preparation**: We clone your repository and run any configured Claude hooks for initialization. The repo will be cloned with the default branch on your GitHub repo. If you would like to check out a specific branch, you can specify that in the prompt.
2. **Network configuration**: We configure internet access for the agent. Internet access is limited by default, but you can configure the environment to have no internet or full internet access based on your needs.
3. **Claude Code execution**: Claude Code runs to complete your task, writing code, running tests, and checking its work. You can guide and steer Claude throughout the session via the web interface. Claude respects context you’ve defined in your `CLAUDE.md`.
4. **Outcome**: When Claude completes its work, it will push the branch to remote. You will be able to create a PR for the branch.

Claude operates entirely through the terminal and CLI tools available in the environment. It uses the pre-installed tools in the universal image and any additional tools you install through hooks or dependency management.

**To add a new environment:** Select the current environment to open the environment selector, and then select “Add environment”. This will open a dialog where you can specify the environment name, network access level, and any environment variables you want to set.
**To update an existing environment:** Select the current environment, to the right of the environment name, and select the settings button. This will open a dialog where you can update the environment name, network access, and environment variables.
**To select your default environment from the terminal:** If you have multiple environments configured, run `/remote-env` to choose which one to use when starting web sessions from your terminal with `&` or `--remote`. With a single environment, this command shows your current configuration.

Environment variables must be specified as key-value pairs, in [`.env` format](https://www.dotenv.org/). For example:

```bash
API_KEY=your_api_key
DEBUG=true
```

### [​](#dependency-management) Dependency management

Configure automatic dependency installation using [SessionStart hooks](/docs/en/hooks#sessionstart). This can be configured in your repository’s `.claude/settings.json` file:

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/scripts/install_pkgs.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Create the corresponding script at `scripts/install_pkgs.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
exit 0
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x scripts/install_pkgs.sh`

#### [​](#local-vs-remote-execution) Local vs remote execution

By default, all hooks execute both locally and in remote (web) environments. To run a hook only in one environment, check the `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` environment variable in your hook script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example: Only run in remote environments
if [ "$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE" != "true" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### [​](#persisting-environment-variables) Persisting environment variables

SessionStart hooks can persist environment variables for subsequent bash commands by writing to the file specified in the `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` environment variable. For details, see [SessionStart hooks](/docs/en/hooks#sessionstart) in the hooks reference.

## [​](#network-access-and-security) Network access and security

### [​](#network-policy) Network policy

#### [​](#github-proxy) GitHub proxy

For security, all GitHub operations go through a dedicated proxy service that transparently handles all git interactions. Inside the sandbox, the git client authenticates using a custom-built scoped credential. This proxy:

- Manages GitHub authentication securely - the git client uses a scoped credential inside the sandbox, which the proxy verifies and translates to your actual GitHub authentication token
- Restricts git push operations to the current working branch for safety
- Enables seamless cloning, fetching, and PR operations while maintaining security boundaries

#### [​](#security-proxy) Security proxy

Environments run behind an HTTP/HTTPS network proxy for security and abuse prevention purposes. All outbound internet traffic passes through this proxy, which provides:

- Protection against malicious requests
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Content filtering for enhanced security

### [​](#access-levels) Access levels

By default, network access is limited to [allowlisted domains](#default-allowed-domains).
You can configure custom network access, including disabling network access.

### [​](#default-allowed-domains) Default allowed domains

When using “Limited” network access, the following domains are allowed by default:

### [​](#security-best-practices-for-customized-network-access) Security best practices for customized network access

1. **Principle of least privilege**: Only enable the minimum network access required
2. **Audit regularly**: Review allowed domains periodically
3. **Use HTTPS**: Always prefer HTTPS endpoints over HTTP

## [​](#security-and-isolation) Security and isolation

Claude Code on the web provides strong security guarantees:

- **Isolated virtual machines**: Each session runs in an isolated, Anthropic-managed VM
- **Network access controls**: Network access is limited by default, and can be disabled

When running with network access disabled, Claude Code is allowed to communicate with the Anthropic API which may still allow data to exit the isolated Claude Code VM.

- **Credential protection**: Sensitive credentials (such as git credentials or signing keys) are never inside the sandbox with Claude Code. Authentication is handled through a secure proxy using scoped credentials
- **Secure analysis**: Code is analyzed and modified within isolated VMs before creating PRs

## [​](#pricing-and-rate-limits) Pricing and rate limits

Claude Code on the web shares rate limits with all other Claude and Claude Code usage within your account. Running multiple tasks in parallel will consume more rate limits proportionately.

## [​](#limitations) Limitations

- **Repository authentication**: You can only move sessions from web to local when you are authenticated to the same account
- **Platform restrictions**: Claude Code on the web only works with code hosted in GitHub. GitLab and other non-GitHub repositories cannot be used with cloud sessions

## [​](#best-practices) Best practices

1. **Use Claude Code hooks**: Configure [SessionStart hooks](/docs/en/hooks#sessionstart) to automate environment setup and dependency installation.
2. **Document requirements**: Clearly specify dependencies and commands in your `CLAUDE.md` file. If you have an `AGENTS.md` file, you can source it in your `CLAUDE.md` using `@AGENTS.md` to maintain a single source of truth.

automation, allowing you to parse Claude’s responses programmatically.

### [​](#agents-flag-format) Agents flag format

The `--agents` flag accepts a JSON object that defines one or more custom subagents. Each subagent requires a unique name (as the key) and a definition object with the following fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | Yes | Natural language description of when the subagent should be invoked |
| `prompt` | Yes | The system prompt that guides the subagent’s behavior |
| `tools` | No | Array of specific tools the subagent can use (for example, `["Read", "Edit", "Bash"]`). If omitted, inherits all tools |
| `model` | No | Model alias to use: `sonnet`, `opus`, or `haiku`. If omitted, uses the default subagent model |

Example:

```bash
claude --agents '{
  "code-reviewer": {
    "description": "Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes.",
    "prompt": "You are a senior code reviewer. Focus on code quality, security, and best practices.",
    "tools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"],
    "model": "sonnet"
  },
  "debugger": {
    "description": "Debugging specialist for errors and test failures.",
    "prompt": "You are an expert debugger. Analyze errors, identify root causes, and provide fixes."
  }
}'
```

For more details on creating and using subagents, see the [subagents documentation](/docs/en/sub-agents).

### [​](#system-prompt-flags) System prompt flags

Claude Code provides four flags for customizing the system prompt, each serving a different purpose:

| Flag | Behavior | Modes | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--system-prompt` | **Replaces** entire default prompt | Interactive + Print | Complete control over Claude’s behavior and instructions |
| `--system-prompt-file` | **Replaces** with file contents | Print only | Load prompts from files for reproducibility and version control |
| `--append-system-prompt` | **Appends** to default prompt | Interactive + Print | Add specific instructions while keeping default Claude Code behavior |
| `--append-system-prompt-file` | **Appends** file contents to default prompt | Print only | Load additional instructions from files while keeping defaults |

**When to use each:**

- **`--system-prompt`**: Use when you need complete control over Claude’s system prompt. This removes all default Claude Code instructions, giving you a blank slate.

  ```bash
  claude --system-prompt "You are a Python expert who only writes type-annotated code"
  ```
- **`--system-prompt-file`**: Use when you want to load a custom prompt from a file, useful for team consistency or version-controlled prompt templates.

  ```bash
  claude -p --system-prompt-file ./prompts/code-review.txt "Review this PR"
  ```
- **`--append-system-prompt`**: Use when you want to add specific instructions while keeping Claude Code’s default capabilities intact. This is the safest option for most use cases.

  ```bash
  claude --append-system-prompt "Always use TypeScript and include JSDoc comments"
  ```
- **`--append-system-prompt-file`**: Use when you want to append instructions from a file while keeping Claude Code’s defaults. Useful for version-controlled additions.

  ```bash
  claude -p --append-system-prompt-file ./prompts/style-rules.txt "Review this PR"
  ```

`--system-prompt` and `--system-prompt-file` are mutually exclusive. The append flags can be used together with either replacement flag.
For most use cases, `--append-system-prompt` or `--append-system-prompt-file` is recommended as they preserve Claude Code’s built-in capabilities while adding your custom requirements. Use `--system-prompt` or `--system-prompt-file` only when you need complete control over the system prompt.

Each task in this document includes clear instructions, example commands, and best practices to help you get the most from Claude Code.

## [​](#understand-new-codebases) Understand new codebases

### [​](#get-a-quick-codebase-overview) Get a quick codebase overview

Suppose you’ve just joined a new project and need to understand its structure quickly.

1

Navigate to the project root directory

```bash
cd /path/to/project
```

2

Start Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

3

Ask for a high-level overview

```bash
> give me an overview of this codebase
```

4

Dive deeper into specific components

```bash
> explain the main architecture patterns used here
```

```bash
> what are the key data models?
```

```bash
> how is authentication handled?
```

Tips:

- Start with broad questions, then narrow down to specific areas
- Ask about coding conventions and patterns used in the project
- Request a glossary of project-specific terms

### [​](#find-relevant-code) Find relevant code

Suppose you need to locate code related to a specific feature or functionality.

1

Ask Claude to find relevant files

```bash
> find the files that handle user authentication
```

2

Get context on how components interact

```bash
> how do these authentication files work together?
```

3

Understand the execution flow

```bash
> trace the login process from front-end to database
```

Tips:

- Be specific about what you’re looking for
- Use domain language from the project

---

## [​](#fix-bugs-efficiently) Fix bugs efficiently

Suppose you’ve encountered an error message and need to find and fix its source.

1

Share the error with Claude

```bash
> I'm seeing an error when I run npm test
```

2

Ask for fix recommendations

```bash
> suggest a few ways to fix the @ts-ignore in user.ts
```

3

Apply the fix

```bash
> update user.ts to add the null check you suggested
```

Tips:

- Tell Claude the command to reproduce the issue and get a stack trace
- Mention any steps to reproduce the error
- Let Claude know if the error is intermittent or consistent

---

## [​](#refactor-code) Refactor code

Suppose you need to update old code to use modern patterns and practices.

1

Identify legacy code for refactoring

```bash
> find deprecated API usage in our codebase
```

2

Get refactoring recommendations

```bash
> suggest how to refactor utils.js to use modern JavaScript features
```

3

Apply the changes safely

```bash
> refactor utils.js to use ES2024 features while maintaining the same behavior
```

4

Verify the refactoring

```bash
> run tests for the refactored code
```

Tips:

- Ask Claude to explain the benefits of the modern approach
- Request that changes maintain backward compatibility when needed
- Do refactoring in small, testable increments

---

## [​](#use-specialized-subagents) Use specialized subagents

Suppose you want to use specialized AI subagents to handle specific tasks more effectively.

1

View available subagents

```bash
> /agents
```

This shows all available subagents and lets you create new ones.

2

Use subagents automatically

Claude Code automatically delegates appropriate tasks to specialized subagents:

```bash
> review my recent code changes for security issues
```

```bash
> run all tests and fix any failures
```

3

Explicitly request specific subagents

```bash
> use the code-reviewer subagent to check the auth module
```

```bash
> have the debugger subagent investigate why users can't log in
```

4

Create custom subagents for your workflow

```bash
> /agents
```

Then select “Create New subagent” and follow the prompts to define:

- A unique identifier that describes the subagent’s purpose (for example, `code-reviewer`, `api-designer`).
- When Claude should use this agent
- Which tools it can access
- A system prompt describing the agent’s role and behavior

Tips:

- Create project-specific subagents in `.claude/agents/` for team sharing
- Use descriptive `description` fields to enable automatic delegation
- Limit tool access to what each subagent actually needs
- Check the [subagents documentation](/docs/en/sub-agents) for detailed examples

## [​](#use-plan-mode-for-safe-code-analysis) Use Plan Mode for safe code analysis

Plan Mode instructs Claude to create a plan by analyzing the codebase with read-only operations, perfect for exploring codebases, planning complex changes, or reviewing code safely. In Plan Mode, Claude uses [`AskUserQuestion`](/docs/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude) to gather requirements and clarify your goals before proposing a plan.

### [​](#when-to-use-plan-mode) When to use Plan Mode

- **Multi-step implementation**: When your feature requires making edits to many files
- **Code exploration**: When you want to research the codebase thoroughly before changing anything
- **Interactive development**: When you want to iterate on the direction with Claude

### [​](#how-to-use-plan-mode) How to use Plan Mode

**Turn on Plan Mode during a session**
You can switch into Plan Mode during a session using **Shift+Tab** to cycle through permission modes.
If you are in Normal Mode, **Shift+Tab** first switches into Auto-Accept Mode, indicated by `⏵⏵ accept edits on` at the bottom of the terminal. A subsequent **Shift+Tab** will switch into Plan Mode, indicated by `⏸ plan mode on`.
**Start a new session in Plan Mode**
To start a new session in Plan Mode, use the `--permission-mode plan` flag:

```bash
claude --permission-mode plan
```

**Run “headless” queries in Plan Mode**
You can also run a query in Plan Mode directly with `-p` (that is, in [“headless mode”](/docs/en/headless)):

```bash
claude --permission-mode plan -p "Analyze the authentication system and suggest improvements"
```

### [​](#example:-planning-a-complex-refactor) Example: Planning a complex refactor

```bash
claude --permission-mode plan
```

```bash
> I need to refactor our authentication system to use OAuth2. Create a detailed migration plan.
```

Claude analyzes the current implementation and create a comprehensive plan. Refine with follow-ups:

```bash
> What about backward compatibility?
> How should we handle database migration?
```

### [​](#configure-plan-mode-as-default) Configure Plan Mode as default

```bash
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "plan"
  }
}
```

See [settings documentation](/docs/en/settings#available-settings) for more configuration options.

## [​](#let-claude-interview-you) Let Claude interview you

For large features, start with a minimal spec and let Claude interview you to fill in the details:

```bash
> Interview me about this feature before you start: user notification system
```

```bash
> Help me think through the requirements for authentication by asking questions
```

```bash
> Ask me clarifying questions to build out this spec: payment processing
```

Claude uses the [`AskUserQuestion`](/docs/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude) tool to ask you multiple-choice questions for gathering requirements, clarifying ambiguity, and understanding your preferences before writing any code. This collaborative approach produces better specs than trying to anticipate every requirement upfront.

When you select “Type something” to provide a custom answer, press **Ctrl+G** to open your default text editor for longer responses.

This behavior is most active in Plan Mode. To encourage it in other modes, add guidance to your `CLAUDE.md` file:

```bash
Always ask clarifying questions when there are multiple valid approaches to a task.
```

If you’re building applications with the Agent SDK and want to surface clarifying questions to your users programmatically, see [Handle approvals and user input](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input#handle-clarifying-questions).

---

## [​](#work-with-tests) Work with tests

Suppose you need to add tests for uncovered code.

1

Identify untested code

```bash
> find functions in NotificationsService.swift that are not covered by tests
```

2

Generate test scaffolding

```bash
> add tests for the notification service
```

3

Add meaningful test cases

```bash
> add test cases for edge conditions in the notification service
```

4

Run and verify tests

```bash
> run the new tests and fix any failures
```

Claude can generate tests that follow your project’s existing patterns and conventions. When asking for tests, be specific about what behavior you want to verify. Claude examines your existing test files to match the style, frameworks, and assertion patterns already in use.
For comprehensive coverage, ask Claude to identify edge cases you might have missed. Claude can analyze your code paths and suggest tests for error conditions, boundary values, and unexpected inputs that are easy to overlook.

---

## [​](#create-pull-requests) Create pull requests

Suppose you need to create a well-documented pull request for your changes.

1

Summarize your changes

```bash
> summarize the changes I've made to the authentication module
```

2

Generate a pull request with Claude

```bash
> create a pr
```

3

Review and refine

```bash
> enhance the PR description with more context about the security improvements
```

4

Add testing details

```bash
> add information about how these changes were tested
```

Tips:

- Ask Claude directly to make a PR for you
- Review Claude’s generated PR before submitting
- Ask Claude to highlight potential risks or considerations

## [​](#handle-documentation) Handle documentation

Suppose you need to add or update documentation for your code.

1

Identify undocumented code

```bash
> find functions without proper JSDoc comments in the auth module
```

2

Generate documentation

```bash
> add JSDoc comments to the undocumented functions in auth.js
```

3

Review and enhance

```bash
> improve the generated documentation with more context and examples
```

4

Verify documentation

```bash
> check if the documentation follows our project standards
```

Tips:

- Specify the documentation style you want (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.)
- Ask for examples in the documentation
- Request documentation for public APIs, interfaces, and complex logic

---

## [​](#work-with-images) Work with images

Suppose you need to work with images in your codebase, and you want Claude’s help analyzing image content.

1

Add an image to the conversation

You can use any of these methods:

1. Drag and drop an image into the Claude Code window
2. Copy an image and paste it into the CLI with ctrl+v (Do not use cmd+v)
3. Provide an image path to Claude. E.g., “Analyze this image: /path/to/your/image.png”

2

Ask Claude to analyze the image

```bash
> What does this image show?
```

```bash
> Describe the UI elements in this screenshot
```

```bash
> Are there any problematic elements in this diagram?
```

3

Use images for context

```bash
> Here's a screenshot of the error. What's causing it?
```

```bash
> This is our current database schema. How should we modify it for the new feature?
```

4

Get code suggestions from visual content

```bash
> Generate CSS to match this design mockup
```

```bash
> What HTML structure would recreate this component?
```

Tips:

- Use images when text descriptions would be unclear or cumbersome
- Include screenshots of errors, UI designs, or diagrams for better context
- You can work with multiple images in a conversation
- Image analysis works with diagrams, screenshots, mockups, and more
- When Claude references images (for example, `[Image #1]`), `Cmd+Click` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Click` (Windows/Linux) the link to open the image in your default viewer

---

## [​](#reference-files-and-directories) Reference files and directories

Use @ to quickly include files or directories without waiting for Claude to read them.

1

Reference a single file

```bash
> Explain the logic in @src/utils/auth.js
```

This includes the full content of the file in the conversation.

2

Reference a directory

```bash
> What's the structure of @src/components?
```

This provides a directory listing with file information.

3

Reference MCP resources

```bash
> Show me the data from @github:repos/owner/repo/issues
```

This fetches data from connected MCP servers using the format @server:resource. See [MCP resources](/docs/en/mcp#use-mcp-resources) for details.

Tips:

- File paths can be relative or absolute
- @ file references add `CLAUDE.md` in the file’s directory and parent directories to context
- Directory references show file listings, not contents
- You can reference multiple files in a single message (for example, “@file1.js and @file2.js”)

---

## [​](#use-extended-thinking-thinking-mode) Use extended thinking (thinking mode)

[Extended thinking](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) is enabled by default, reserving a portion of the output token budget (up to 31,999 tokens) for Claude to reason through complex problems step-by-step. This reasoning is visible in verbose mode, which you can toggle on with `Ctrl+O`.
Extended thinking is particularly valuable for complex architectural decisions, challenging bugs, multi-step implementation planning, and evaluating tradeoffs between different approaches. It provides more space for exploring multiple solutions, analyzing edge cases, and self-correcting mistakes.

Phrases like “think”, “think hard”, “ultrathink”, and “think more” are interpreted as regular prompt instructions and don’t allocate thinking tokens.

### [​](#configure-thinking-mode) Configure thinking mode

Thinking is enabled by default, but you can adjust or disable it.

| Scope | How to configure | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Toggle shortcut** | Press `Option+T` (macOS) or `Alt+T` (Windows/Linux) | Toggle thinking on/off for the current session. May require [terminal configuration](/docs/en/terminal-config) to enable Option key shortcuts |
| **Global default** | Use `/config` to toggle thinking mode | Sets your default across all projects. Saved as `alwaysThinkingEnabled` in `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| **Limit token budget** | Set [`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) environment variable | Limit the thinking budget to a specific number of tokens. Example: `export MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=10000` |

To view Claude’s thinking process, press `Ctrl+O` to toggle verbose mode and see the internal reasoning displayed as gray italic text.

### [​](#how-extended-thinking-token-budgets-work) How extended thinking token budgets work

Extended thinking uses a **token budget** that controls how much internal reasoning Claude can perform before responding.
A larger thinking token budget provides:

- More space to explore multiple solution approaches step-by-step
- Room to analyze edge cases and evaluate tradeoffs thoroughly
- Ability to revise reasoning and self-correct mistakes

Token budgets for thinking mode:

- When thinking is **enabled**, Claude can use up to **31,999 tokens** from your output budget for internal reasoning
- When thinking is **disabled** (via toggle or `/config`), Claude uses **0 tokens** for thinking

**Limit the thinking budget:**

- Use the [`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` environment variable](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) to cap the thinking budget
- When set, this value limits the maximum tokens Claude can use for thinking
- See the [extended thinking documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for valid token ranges

You’re charged for all thinking tokens used, even though Claude 4 models show summarized thinking

---

## [​](#resume-previous-conversations) Resume previous conversations

When starting Claude Code, you can resume a previous session:

- `claude --continue` continues the most recent conversation in the current directory
- `claude --resume` opens a conversation picker or resumes by name

From inside an active session, use `/resume` to switch to a different conversation.
Sessions are stored per project directory. The `/resume` picker shows sessions from the same git repository, including worktrees.

### [​](#name-your-sessions) Name your sessions

Give sessions descriptive names to find them later. This is a best practice when working on multiple tasks or features.

1

Name the current session

Use `/rename` during a session to give it a memorable name:

```bash
> /rename auth-refactor
```

You can also rename any session from the picker: run `/resume`, navigate to a session, and press `R`.

2

Resume by name later

From the command line:

```bash
claude --resume auth-refactor
```

Or from inside an active session:

```bash
> /resume auth-refactor
```

### [​](#use-the-session-picker) Use the session picker

The `/resume` command (or `claude --resume` without arguments) opens an interactive session picker with these features:
**Keyboard shortcuts in the picker:**

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate between sessions |
| `→` / `←` | Expand or collapse grouped sessions |
| `Enter` | Select and resume the highlighted session |
| `P` | Preview the session content |
| `R` | Rename the highlighted session |
| `/` | Search to filter sessions |
| `A` | Toggle between current directory and all projects |
| `B` | Filter to sessions from your current git branch |
| `Esc` | Exit the picker or search mode |

**Session organization:**
The picker displays sessions with helpful metadata:

- Session name or initial prompt
- Time elapsed since last activity
- Message count
- Git branch (if applicable)

Forked sessions (created with `/rewind` or `--fork-session`) are grouped together under their root session, making it easier to find related conversations.

Tips:

- **Name sessions early**: Use `/rename` when starting work on a distinct task—it’s much easier to find “payment-integration” than “explain this function” later
- Use `--continue` for quick access to your most recent conversation in the current directory
- Use `--resume session-name` when you know which session you need
- Use `--resume` (without a name) when you need to browse and select
- For scripts, use `claude --continue --print "prompt"` to resume in non-interactive mode
- Press `P` in the picker to preview a session before resuming it
- The resumed conversation starts with the same model and configuration as the original

How it works:

1. **Conversation Storage**: All conversations are automatically saved locally with their full message history
2. **Message Deserialization**: When resuming, the entire message history is restored to maintain context
3. **Tool State**: Tool usage and results from the previous conversation are preserved
4. **Context Restoration**: The conversation resumes with all previous context intact

## [​](#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees) Run parallel Claude Code sessions with Git worktrees

Suppose you need to work on multiple tasks simultaneously with complete code isolation between Claude Code instances.

1

Understand Git worktrees

Git worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches from the same
repository into separate directories. Each worktree has its own working
directory with isolated files, while sharing the same Git history. Learn
more in the [official Git worktree
documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree).

2

Create a new worktree

```bash
# Create a new worktree with a new branch
git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a

# Or create a worktree with an existing branch
git worktree add ../project-bugfix bugfix-123
```

This creates a new directory with a separate working copy of your repository.

3

Run Claude Code in each worktree

```bash
# Navigate to your worktree
cd ../project-feature-a

# Run Claude Code in this isolated environment
claude
```

4

Run Claude in another worktree

```bash
cd ../project-bugfix
claude
```

5

Manage your worktrees

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree when done
git worktree remove ../project-feature-a
```

Tips:

- Each worktree has its own independent file state, making it perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions
- Changes made in one worktree won’t affect others, preventing Claude instances from interfering with each other
- All worktrees share the same Git history and remote connections
- For long-running tasks, you can have Claude working in one worktree while you continue development in another
- Use descriptive directory names to easily identify which task each worktree is for
- Remember to initialize your development environment in each new worktree according to your project’s setup. Depending on your stack, this might include:
  - JavaScript projects: Running dependency installation (`npm install`, `yarn`)
  - Python projects: Setting up virtual environments or installing with package managers
  - Other languages: Following your project’s standard setup process

---

## [​](#use-claude-as-a-unix-style-utility) Use Claude as a unix-style utility

### [​](#add-claude-to-your-verification-process) Add Claude to your verification process

Suppose you want to use Claude Code as a linter or code reviewer.
**Add Claude to your build script:**

```bash
// package.json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "lint:claude": "claude -p 'you are a linter. please look at the changes vs. main and report any issues related to typos. report the filename and line number on one line, and a description of the issue on the second line. do not return any other text.'"
    }
}
```

Tips:

- Use Claude for automated code review in your CI/CD pipeline
- Customize the prompt to check for specific issues relevant to your project
- Consider creating multiple scripts for different types of verification

### [​](#pipe-in,-pipe-out) Pipe in, pipe out

Suppose you want to pipe data into Claude, and get back data in a structured format.
**Pipe data through Claude:**

```bash
cat build-error.txt | claude -p 'concisely explain the root cause of this build error' > output.txt
```

Tips:

- Use pipes to integrate Claude into existing shell scripts
- Combine with other Unix tools for powerful workflows
- Consider using —output-format for structured output

### [​](#control-output-format) Control output format

Suppose you need Claude’s output in a specific format, especially when integrating Claude Code into scripts or other tools.

1

Use text format (default)

```bash
cat data.txt | claude -p 'summarize this data' --output-format text > summary.txt
```

This outputs just Claude’s plain text response (default behavior).

2

Use JSON format

```bash
cat code.py | claude -p 'analyze this code for bugs' --output-format json > analysis.json
```

This outputs a JSON array of messages with metadata including cost and duration.

3

Use streaming JSON format

```bash
cat log.txt | claude -p 'parse this log file for errors' --output-format stream-json
```

This outputs a series of JSON objects in real-time as Claude processes the request. Each message is a valid JSON object, but the entire output is not valid JSON if concatenated.

Tips:

- Use `--output-format text` for simple integrations where you just need Claude’s response
- Use `--output-format json` when you need the full conversation log
- Use `--output-format stream-json` for real-time output of each conversation turn

---

## [​](#create-custom-slash-commands) Create custom slash commands

Claude Code supports custom slash commands that you can create to quickly execute specific prompts or tasks.
For more details, see the [Slash commands](/docs/en/slash-commands) reference page.

### [​](#create-project-specific-commands) Create project-specific commands

Suppose you want to create reusable slash commands for your project that all team members can use.

1

Create a commands directory in your project

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands
```

2

Create a Markdown file for each command

```bash
echo "Analyze the performance of this code and suggest three specific optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

3

Use your custom command in Claude Code

```bash
> /optimize
```

Tips:

- Command names are derived from the filename (for example, `optimize.md` becomes `/optimize`)
- You can organize commands in subdirectories (for example, `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates `/component` with “(project:frontend)” shown in the description)
- Project commands are available to everyone who clones the repository
- The Markdown file content becomes the prompt sent to Claude when the command is invoked

### [​](#add-command-arguments-with-$arguments) Add command arguments with $ARGUMENTS

Suppose you want to create flexible slash commands that can accept additional input from users.

1

Create a command file with the $ARGUMENTS placeholder

```bash
echo 'Find and fix issue #$ARGUMENTS. Follow these steps: 1.
Understand the issue described in the ticket 2. Locate the relevant code in
our codebase 3. Implement a solution that addresses the root cause 4. Add
appropriate tests 5. Prepare a concise PR description' >
.claude/commands/fix-issue.md
```

2

Use the command with an issue number

In your Claude session, use the command with arguments.

```bash
> /fix-issue 123
```

This replaces $ARGUMENTS with “123” in the prompt.

Tips:

- The $ARGUMENTS placeholder is replaced with any text that follows the command
- You can position $ARGUMENTS anywhere in your command template
- Other useful applications: generating test cases for specific functions, creating documentation for components, reviewing code in particular files, or translating content to specified languages

### [​](#create-personal-slash-commands) Create personal slash commands

Suppose you want to create personal slash commands that work across all your projects.

1

Create a commands directory in your home folder

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
```

2

Create a Markdown file for each command

```bash
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities, focusing on:" >
~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

3

Use your personal custom command

```bash
> /security-review
```

Tips:

- Personal commands show “(user)” in their description when listed with `/help`
- Personal commands are only available to you and not shared with your team
- Personal commands work across all your projects
- You can use these for consistent workflows across different codebases

---

## [​](#ask-claude-about-its-capabilities) Ask Claude about its capabilities

Claude has built-in access to its documentation and can answer questions about its own features and limitations.

### [​](#example-questions) Example questions

```bash
> can Claude Code create pull requests?
```

```bash
> how does Claude Code handle permissions?
```

```bash
> what slash commands are available?
```

```bash
> how do I use MCP with Claude Code?
```

```bash
> how do I configure Claude Code for Amazon Bedrock?
```

```bash
> what are the limitations of Claude Code?
```

Claude provides documentation-based answers to these questions. For executable examples and hands-on demonstrations, refer to the specific workflow sections above.

Tips:

- Claude always has access to the latest Claude Code documentation, regardless of the version you’re using
- Ask specific questions to get detailed answers
- Claude can explain complex features like MCP integration, enterprise configurations, and advanced workflows

## [​](#next-steps) Next steps

[## Claude Code reference implementation

Clone our development container reference implementation.](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer)
---

---
source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/costs
title: Manage costs effectively
---

Claude Code consumes tokens for each interaction. The average cost is $6 per developer per day, with daily costs remaining below $12 for 90% of users.
For team usage, Claude Code charges by API token consumption. On average, Claude Code costs ~$100-200/developer per month with Sonnet 4.5 though there is large variance depending on how many instances users are running and whether they’re using it in automation.

## [​](#track-your-costs) Track your costs

### [​](#using-the-/cost-command) Using the `/cost` command

The `/cost` command is not intended for Claude Max and Pro subscribers.

The `/cost` command provides detailed token usage statistics for your current session:

```bash
Total cost:            $0.55
Total duration (API):  6m 19.7s
Total duration (wall): 6h 33m 10.2s
Total code changes:    0 lines added, 0 lines removed
```

### [​](#additional-tracking-options) Additional tracking options

Check [historical usage](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9534590-cost-and-usage-reporting-in-console) in the Claude Console (requires Admin or Billing role) and set [workspace spend limits](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9796807-creating-and-managing-workspaces) for the Claude Code workspace (requires Admin role).

When you first authenticate Claude Code with your Claude Console account, a workspace called “Claude Code” is automatically created for you. This workspace provides centralized cost tracking and management for all Claude Code usage in your organization. You cannot create API keys for this workspace - it is exclusively for Claude Code authentication and usage.

## [​](#managing-costs-for-teams) Managing costs for teams

When using Claude API, you can limit the total Claude Code workspace spend. To configure, [follow these instructions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9796807-creating-and-managing-workspaces). Admins can view cost and usage reporting by [following these instructions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9534590-cost-and-usage-reporting-in-console).
On Bedrock and Vertex, Claude Code does not send metrics from your cloud. In order to get cost metrics, several large enterprises reported using [LiteLLM](/docs/en/third-party-integrations#litellm), which is an open-source tool that helps companies [track spend by key](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/virtual_keys#tracking-spend). This project is unaffiliated with Anthropic and we have not audited its security.

### [​](#rate-limit-recommendations) Rate limit recommendations

When setting up Claude Code for teams, consider these Token Per Minute (TPM) and Request Per Minute (RPM) per-user recommendations based on your organization size:

| Team size | TPM per user | RPM per user |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-5 users | 200k-300k | 5-7 |
| 5-20 users | 100k-150k | 2.5-3.5 |
| 20-50 users | 50k-75k | 1.25-1.75 |
| 50-100 users | 25k-35k | 0.62-0.87 |
| 100-500 users | 15k-20k | 0.37-0.47 |
| 500+ users | 10k-15k | 0.25-0.35 |

For example, if you have 200 users, you might request 20k TPM for each user, or 4 million total TPM (200\*20,000 = 4 million).
The TPM per user decreases as team size grows because we expect fewer users to use Claude Code concurrently in larger organizations. These rate limits apply at the organization level, not per individual user, which means individual users can temporarily consume more than their calculated share when others aren’t actively using the service.

If you anticipate scenarios with unusually high concurrent usage (such as live training sessions with large groups), you may need higher TPM allocations per user.

## [​](#reduce-token-usage) Reduce token usage

- **Compact conversations:**
  - Claude uses auto-compact by default when context reaches approximately 95% capacity. To trigger compaction earlier, set [`CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE`](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) to a lower percentage (for example, `50`)
  - Toggle auto-compact: Run `/config` and navigate to “Auto-compact enabled”
  - Use `/compact` manually when context gets large
  - Add custom instructions: `/compact Focus on code samples and API usage`
  - Customize compaction by adding to CLAUDE.md:

    ```bash
    # Summary instructions

    When you are using compact, please focus on test output and code changes
    ```
- **Write specific queries:** Avoid vague requests that trigger unnecessary scanning
- **Break down complex tasks:** Split large tasks into focused interactions
- **Clear history between tasks:** Use `/clear` to reset context

Costs can vary significantly based on:

- Size of codebase being analyzed
- Complexity of queries
- Number of files being searched or modified
- Length of conversation history
- Frequency of compacting conversations

## [​](#background-token-usage) Background token usage

Claude Code uses tokens for some background functionality even when idle:

- **Conversation summarization**: Background jobs that summarize previous conversations for the `claude --resume` feature
- **Command processing**: Some commands like `/cost` may generate requests to check status

These background processes consume a small amount of tokens (typically under $0.04 per session) even without active interaction.

## [​](#tracking-version-changes-and-updates) Tracking version changes and updates

### [​](#current-version-information) Current version information

To check your current Claude Code version and installation details:

```bash
claude doctor
```

This command shows your version, installation type, and system information.

### [​](#understanding-changes-in-claude-code-behavior) Understanding changes in Claude Code behavior

Claude Code regularly receives updates that may change how features work, including cost reporting:

- **Version tracking**: Use `claude doctor` to see your current version
- **Behavior changes**: Features like `/cost` may display information differently across versions
- **Documentation access**: Claude always has access to the latest documentation, which can help explain current feature behavior

### [​](#when-cost-reporting-changes) When cost reporting changes

If you notice changes in how costs are displayed (such as the `/cost` command showing different information):

1. **Verify your version**: Run `claude doctor` to confirm your current version
2. **Consult documentation**: Ask Claude directly about current feature behavior, as it has access to up-to-date documentation
3. **Contact support**: For specific billing questions, contact Anthropic support through your Console account

For team deployments, we recommend starting with a small pilot group to
establish usage patterns before wider rollout.

## [​](#data-policies) Data policies

### [​](#data-training-policy) Data training policy

**Consumer users (Free, Pro, and Max plans)**:
We give you the choice to allow your data to be used to improve future Claude models. We will train new models using data from Free, Pro, and Max accounts when this setting is on (including when you use Claude Code from these accounts).
**Commercial users**: (Team and Enterprise plans, API, 3rd-party platforms, and Claude Gov) maintain existing policies: Anthropic does not train generative models using code or prompts sent to Claude Code under commercial terms, unless the customer has chosen to provide their data to us for model improvement (for example, the [Developer Partner Program](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11174108-about-the-development-partner-program)).

### [​](#development-partner-program) Development Partner Program

If you explicitly opt in to methods to provide us with materials to train on, such as via the [Development Partner Program](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11174108-about-the-development-partner-program), we may use those materials provided to train our models. An organization admin can expressly opt-in to the Development Partner Program for their organization. Note that this program is available only for Anthropic first-party API, and not for Bedrock or Vertex users.

### [​](#feedback-using-the-/bug-command) Feedback using the `/bug` command

If you choose to send us feedback about Claude Code using the `/bug` command, we may use your feedback to improve our products and services. Transcripts shared via `/bug` are retained for 5 years.

### [​](#session-quality-surveys) Session quality surveys

When you see the “How is Claude doing this session?” prompt in Claude Code, responding to this survey (including selecting “Dismiss”), only your numeric rating (1, 2, 3, or dismiss) is recorded. We do not collect or store any conversation transcripts, inputs, outputs, or other session data as part of this survey. Unlike thumbs up/down feedback or `/bug` reports, this session quality survey is a simple product satisfaction metric. Your responses to this survey do not impact your data training preferences and cannot be used to train our AI models.

### [​](#data-retention) Data retention

Anthropic retains Claude Code data based on your account type and preferences.
**Consumer users (Free, Pro, and Max plans)**:

- Users who allow data use for model improvement: 5-year retention period to support model development and safety improvements
- Users who don’t allow data use for model improvement: 30-day retention period
- Privacy settings can be changed at any time at [claude.ai/settings/data-privacy-controls](https://claude.ai/settings/data-privacy-controls).

**Commercial users (Team, Enterprise, and API)**:

- Standard: 30-day retention period
- Zero data retention: Available with appropriately configured API keys - Claude Code will not retain chat transcripts on servers
- Local caching: Claude Code clients may store sessions locally for up to 30 days to enable session resumption (configurable)

Learn more about data retention practices in our [Privacy Center](https://privacy.anthropic.com/).
For full details, please review our [Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms) (for Team, Enterprise, and API users) or [Consumer Terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/consumer-terms) (for Free, Pro, and Max users) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy).

## [​](#data-access) Data access

For all first party users, you can learn more about what data is logged for [local Claude Code](#local-claude-code-data-flow-and-dependencies) and [remote Claude Code](#cloud-execution-data-flow-and-dependencies). Note for remote Claude Code, Claude accesses the repository where you initiate your Claude Code session. Claude does not access repositories that you have connected but have not started a session in.

## [​](#local-claude-code:-data-flow-and-dependencies) Local Claude Code: Data flow and dependencies

The diagram below shows how Claude Code connects to external services during installation and normal operation. Solid lines indicate required connections, while dashed lines represent optional or user-initiated data flows.
![Diagram showing Claude Code's external connections: install/update connects to NPM, and user requests connect to Anthropic services including Console auth, public-api, and optionally Statsig, Sentry, and bug reporting](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/I9Dpo7RZuIbc86cX/images/claude-code-data-flow.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=I9Dpo7RZuIbc86cX&q=85&s=9e77f476347e7c9983f6e211d27cf6a9)
Claude Code is installed from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code). Claude Code runs locally. In order to interact with the LLM, Claude Code sends data over the network. This data includes all user prompts and model outputs. The data is encrypted in transit via TLS and is not encrypted at rest. Claude Code is compatible with most popular VPNs and LLM proxies.
Claude Code is built on Anthropic’s APIs. For details regarding our API’s security controls, including our API logging procedures, please refer to compliance artifacts offered in the [Anthropic Trust Center](https://trust.anthropic.com).

### [​](#cloud-execution:-data-flow-and-dependencies) Cloud execution: Data flow and dependencies

When using [Claude Code on the web](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web), sessions run in Anthropic-managed virtual machines instead of locally. In cloud environments:

- **Code and data storage:** Your repository is cloned to an isolated VM. Code and session data are subject to the retention and usage policies for your account type (see Data retention section above)
- **Credentials:** GitHub authentication is handled through a secure proxy; your GitHub credentials never enter the sandbox
- **Network traffic:** All outbound traffic goes through a security proxy for audit logging and abuse prevention
- **Session data:** Prompts, code changes, and outputs follow the same data policies as local Claude Code usage

For security details about cloud execution, see [Security](/docs/en/security#cloud-execution-security).

## [​](#telemetry-services) Telemetry services

Claude Code connects from users’ machines to the Statsig service to log operational metrics such as latency, reliability, and usage patterns. This logging does not include any code or file paths. Data is encrypted in transit using TLS and at rest using 256-bit AES encryption. Read more in the [Statsig security documentation](https://www.statsig.com/trust/security). To opt out of Statsig telemetry, set the `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable.
Claude Code connects from users’ machines to Sentry for operational error logging. The data is encrypted in transit using TLS and at rest using 256-bit AES encryption. Read more in the [Sentry security documentation](https://sentry.io/security/). To opt out of error logging, set the `DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING` environment variable.
When users run the `/bug` command, a copy of their full conversation history including code is sent to Anthropic. The data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Optionally, a Github issue is created in our public repository. To opt out of bug reporting, set the `DISABLE_BUG_COMMAND` environment variable.

## [​](#default-behaviors-by-api-provider) Default behaviors by API provider

By default, we disable all non-essential traffic (including error reporting, telemetry, and bug reporting functionality) when using Bedrock or Vertex. You can also opt out of all of these at once by setting the `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` environment variable. Here are the full default behaviors:

| Service | Claude API | Vertex API | Bedrock API |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Statsig (Metrics)** | Default on. `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` to disable. | Default off. `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX` must be 1. | Default off. `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` must be 1. |
| **Sentry (Errors)** | Default on. `DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING=1` to disable. | Default off. `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX` must be 1. | Default off. `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` must be 1. |
| **Claude API (`/bug` reports)** | Default on. `DISABLE_BUG_COMMAND=1` to disable. | Default off. `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX` must be 1. | Default off. `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` must be 1. |

All environment variables can be checked into `settings.json` ([read more](/docs/en/settings)).

![Claude Code on desktop interface](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/zEGbGSbinVtT3BLw/images/desktop-interface.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=zEGbGSbinVtT3BLw&q=85&s=c4e9dc9737b437d36ab253b75a1cc595)

## [​](#claude-code-on-desktop-preview) Claude Code on desktop (Preview)

The Claude desktop app provides a native interface for running multiple Claude Code sessions on your local machine and seamless integration with Claude Code on the web.

## [​](#installation) Installation

Download the Claude desktop app for your platform:

[## macOS

Universal build for Intel and Apple Silicon](https://claude.ai/api/desktop/darwin/universal/dmg/latest/redirect?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs)[## Windows

For x64 processors](https://claude.ai/api/desktop/win32/x64/exe/latest/redirect?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs)

For Windows ARM64, [download here](https://claude.ai/api/desktop/win32/arm64/exe/latest/redirect?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs).

Local sessions are not available on Windows ARM64.

## [​](#features) Features

Claude Code on desktop provides:

- **Parallel local sessions with `git` worktrees**: Run multiple Claude Code sessions simultaneously in the same repository, each with its own isolated `git` worktree
- **Include files listed in your `.gitignore` in your worktrees**: Automatically copy files in your `.gitignore`, like `.env`, to new worktrees using `.worktreeinclude`
- **Launch Claude Code on the web**: Kick off secure cloud sessions directly from the desktop app

## [​](#using-git-worktrees) Using Git worktrees

Claude Code on desktop enables running multiple Claude Code sessions in the same repository using Git worktrees. Each session gets its own isolated worktree, allowing Claude to work on different tasks without conflicts. The default location for worktrees is `~/.claude-worktrees` but this can be configured in your settings on the Claude desktop app.

If you start a local session in a folder that does not have Git initialized, the desktop app will not create a new worktree.

### [​](#copying-files-ignored-with-gitignore) Copying files ignored with `.gitignore`

When Claude Code creates a worktree, files ignored via `.gitignore` aren’t automatically available. Including a `.worktreeinclude` file solves this by specifying which ignored files should be copied to new worktrees.
Create a `.worktreeinclude` file in your repository root:

```bash
.env
.env.local
.env.*
**/.claude/settings.local.json
```

The file uses `.gitignore`-style patterns. When a worktree is created, files matching these patterns that are also in your `.gitignore` will be copied from your main repository to the worktree.

Only files that are both matched by `.worktreeinclude` AND listed in `.gitignore` are copied. This prevents accidentally duplicating tracked files.

### [​](#launch-claude-code-on-the-web) Launch Claude Code on the web

From the desktop app, you can kick off Claude Code sessions that run on Anthropic’s secure cloud infrastructure.
To start a web session from desktop, select a remote environment when creating a new session.
For more details, see [Claude Code on the web](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web).

## [​](#bundled-claude-code-version) Bundled Claude Code version

Claude Code on desktop includes a bundled, stable version of Claude Code to ensure a consistent experience for all desktop users. The bundled version is required and downloaded on first launch even if a version of Claude Code exists on the computer. Desktop automatically manages version updates and cleans up old versions.

The bundled Claude Code version in Desktop may differ from the latest CLI version. Desktop prioritizes stability while the CLI may have newer features.

## [​](#environment-configuration) Environment configuration

For local environments, Claude Code on desktop automatically extracts your `$PATH` environment variable from your shell configuration. This allows local sessions to access development tools like `yarn`, `npm`, `node`, and other commands available in your terminal without additional setup.

### [​](#custom-environment-variables) Custom environment variables

Select “Local” environment, then to the right, select the settings button. This will open a dialog where you can update local environment variables. This is useful for setting project-specific variables or API keys that your development workflows require. Environment variable values are masked in the UI for security reasons.

Environment variables must be specified as key-value pairs, in [`.env` format](https://www.dotenv.org/). For example:

```bash
API_KEY=your_api_key
DEBUG=true

# Multiline values - wrap in quotes
CERT="-----BEGIN CERT-----
MIIE...
-----END CERT-----"
```

## [​](#enterprise-configuration) Enterprise configuration

Organizations can disable local Claude Code use in the desktop application with the `isClaudeCodeForDesktopEnabled` [enterprise policy option](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12622667-enterprise-configuration#h_003283c7cb). Additionally, Claude Code on the web can be disabled in your [admin settings](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-code).

title: Development containers
---

The reference [devcontainer setup](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) and associated [Dockerfile](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile) offer a preconfigured development container that you can use as is, or customize for your needs. This devcontainer works with the Visual Studio Code [Dev Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) and similar tools.
The container’s enhanced security measures (isolation and firewall rules) allow you to run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` to bypass permission prompts for unattended operation.

While the devcontainer provides substantial protections, no system is completely immune to all attacks.
When executed with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, devcontainers don’t prevent a malicious project from exfiltrating anything accessible in the devcontainer including Claude Code credentials.
We recommend only using devcontainers when developing with trusted repositories.
Always maintain good security practices and monitor Claude’s activities.

## [​](#key-features) Key features

- **Production-ready Node.js**: Built on Node.js 20 with essential development dependencies
- **Security by design**: Custom firewall restricting network access to only necessary services
- **Developer-friendly tools**: Includes git, ZSH with productivity enhancements, fzf, and more
- **Seamless VS Code integration**: Pre-configured extensions and optimized settings
- **Session persistence**: Preserves command history and configurations between container restarts
- **Works everywhere**: Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux development environments

## [​](#getting-started-in-4-steps) Getting started in 4 steps

1. Install VS Code and the Remote - Containers extension
2. Clone the [Claude Code reference implementation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) repository
3. Open the repository in VS Code
4. When prompted, click “Reopen in Container” (or use Command Palette: Cmd+Shift+P → “Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container”)

## [​](#configuration-breakdown) Configuration breakdown

The devcontainer setup consists of three primary components:

- [**devcontainer.json**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json): Controls container settings, extensions, and volume mounts
- [**Dockerfile**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile): Defines the container image and installed tools
- [**init-firewall.sh**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/init-firewall.sh): Establishes network security rules

## [​](#security-features) Security features

The container implements a multi-layered security approach with its firewall configuration:

- **Precise access control**: Restricts outbound connections to whitelisted domains only (npm registry, GitHub, Claude API, etc.)
- **Allowed outbound connections**: The firewall permits outbound DNS and SSH connections
- **Default-deny policy**: Blocks all other external network access
- **Startup verification**: Validates firewall rules when the container initializes
- **Isolation**: Creates a secure development environment separated from your main system

## [​](#customization-options) Customization options

The devcontainer configuration is designed to be adaptable to your needs:

- Add or remove VS Code extensions based on your workflow
- Modify resource allocations for different hardware environments
- Adjust network access permissions
- Customize shell configurations and developer tooling

## [​](#example-use-cases) Example use cases

### [​](#secure-client-work) Secure client work

Use devcontainers to isolate different client projects, ensuring code and credentials never mix between environments.

### [​](#team-onboarding) Team onboarding

New team members can get a fully configured development environment in minutes, with all necessary tools and settings pre-installed.

### [​](#consistent-ci/cd-environments) Consistent CI/CD environments

Mirror your devcontainer configuration in CI/CD pipelines to ensure development and production environments match.

source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins
title: Discover and install prebuilt plugins through marketplaces
---

Plugins extend Claude Code with custom commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers. Plugin marketplaces are catalogs that help you discover and install these extensions without building them yourself.
Looking to create and distribute your own marketplace? See [Create and distribute a plugin marketplace](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).

## [​](#how-marketplaces-work) How marketplaces work

A marketplace is a catalog of plugins that someone else has created and shared. Using a marketplace is a two-step process:

1

Add the marketplace

This registers the catalog with Claude Code so you can browse what’s available. No plugins are installed yet.

2

Install individual plugins

Browse the catalog and install the plugins you want.

Think of it like adding an app store: adding the store gives you access to browse its collection, but you still choose which apps to download individually.

## [​](#official-anthropic-marketplace) Official Anthropic marketplace

The official Anthropic marketplace (`claude-plugins-official`) is automatically available when you start Claude Code. Run `/plugin` and go to the **Discover** tab to browse what’s available.
To install a plugin from the official marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install plugin-name@claude-plugins-official
```

The official marketplace is maintained by Anthropic. To distribute your own plugins, [create your own marketplace](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) and share it with users.

The official marketplace includes several categories of plugins:

### [​](#code-intelligence) Code intelligence

Code intelligence plugins help Claude understand your codebase more deeply. With these plugins installed, Claude can jump to definitions, find references, and see type errors immediately after edits. These plugins use the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP), the same technology that powers VS Code’s code intelligence.
These plugins require the language server binary to be installed on your system. If you already have a language server installed, Claude may prompt you to install the corresponding plugin when you open a project.

| Language | Plugin | Binary required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C/C++ | `clangd-lsp` | `clangd` |
| C# | `csharp-lsp` | `csharp-ls` |
| Go | `gopls-lsp` | `gopls` |
| Java | `jdtls-lsp` | `jdtls` |
| Lua | `lua-lsp` | `lua-language-server` |
| PHP | `php-lsp` | `intelephense` |
| Python | `pyright-lsp` | `pyright-langserver` |
| Rust | `rust-analyzer-lsp` | `rust-analyzer` |
| Swift | `swift-lsp` | `sourcekit-lsp` |
| TypeScript | `typescript-lsp` | `typescript-language-server` |

You can also [create your own LSP plugin](/docs/en/plugins-reference#lsp-servers) for other languages.

If you see `Executable not found in $PATH` in the `/plugin` Errors tab after installing a plugin, install the required binary from the table above.

### [​](#external-integrations) External integrations

These plugins bundle pre-configured [MCP servers](/docs/en/mcp) so you can connect Claude to external services without manual setup:

- **Source control**: `github`, `gitlab`
- **Project management**: `atlassian` (Jira/Confluence), `asana`, `linear`, `notion`
- **Design**: `figma`
- **Infrastructure**: `vercel`, `firebase`, `supabase`
- **Communication**: `slack`
- **Monitoring**: `sentry`

### [​](#development-workflows) Development workflows

Plugins that add commands and agents for common development tasks:

- **commit-commands**: Git commit workflows including commit, push, and PR creation
- **pr-review-toolkit**: Specialized agents for reviewing pull requests
- **agent-sdk-dev**: Tools for building with the Claude Agent SDK
- **plugin-dev**: Toolkit for creating your own plugins

### [​](#output-styles) Output styles

Customize how Claude responds:

- **explanatory-output-style**: Educational insights about implementation choices
- **learning-output-style**: Interactive learning mode for skill building

## [​](#try-it:-add-the-demo-marketplace) Try it: add the demo marketplace

Anthropic also maintains a [demo plugins marketplace](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins) (`claude-code-plugins`) with example plugins that show what’s possible with the plugin system. Unlike the official marketplace, you need to add this one manually.

1

Add the marketplace

From within Claude Code, run the `plugin marketplace add` command for the `anthropics/claude-code` marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code
```

This downloads the marketplace catalog and makes its plugins available to you.

2

Browse available plugins

Run `/plugin` to open the plugin manager. This opens a tabbed interface with four tabs you can cycle through using **Tab** (or **Shift+Tab** to go backward):

- **Discover**: browse available plugins from all your marketplaces
- **Installed**: view and manage your installed plugins
- **Marketplaces**: add, remove, or update your added marketplaces
- **Errors**: view any plugin loading errors

Go to the **Discover** tab to see plugins from the marketplace you just added.

3

Install a plugin

Select a plugin to view its details, then choose an installation scope:

- **User scope**: install for yourself across all projects
- **Project scope**: install for all collaborators on this repository
- **Local scope**: install for yourself in this repository only

For example, select **commit-commands** (a plugin that adds git workflow commands) and install it to your user scope.You can also install directly from the command line:

```bash
/plugin install commit-commands@anthropics-claude-code
```

See [Configuration scopes](/docs/en/settings#configuration-scopes) to learn more about scopes.

4

Use your new plugin

After installing, the plugin’s commands are immediately available. Plugin commands are namespaced by the plugin name, so **commit-commands** provides commands like `/commit-commands:commit`.Try it out by making a change to a file and running:

```bash
/commit-commands:commit
```

This stages your changes, generates a commit message, and creates the commit.Each plugin works differently. Check the plugin’s description in the **Discover** tab or its homepage to learn what commands and capabilities it provides.

The rest of this guide covers all the ways you can add marketplaces, install plugins, and manage your configuration.

## [​](#add-marketplaces) Add marketplaces

Use the `/plugin marketplace add` command to add marketplaces from different sources.

**Shortcuts**: You can use `/plugin market` instead of `/plugin marketplace`, and `rm` instead of `remove`.

- **GitHub repositories**: `owner/repo` format (for example, `anthropics/claude-code`)
- **Git URLs**: any git repository URL (GitLab, Bitbucket, self-hosted)
- **Local paths**: directories or direct paths to `marketplace.json` files
- **Remote URLs**: direct URLs to hosted `marketplace.json` files

### [​](#add-from-github) Add from GitHub

Add a GitHub repository that contains a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file using the `owner/repo` format—where `owner` is the GitHub username or organization and `repo` is the repository name.
For example, `anthropics/claude-code` refers to the `claude-code` repository owned by `anthropics`:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code
```

### [​](#add-from-other-git-hosts) Add from other Git hosts

Add any git repository by providing the full URL. This works with any Git host, including GitLab, Bitbucket, and self-hosted servers:
Using HTTPS:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git
```

Using SSH:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add [email protected]:company/plugins.git
```

To add a specific branch or tag, append `#` followed by the ref:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git#v1.0.0
```

### [​](#add-from-local-paths) Add from local paths

Add a local directory that contains a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ./my-marketplace
```

You can also add a direct path to a `marketplace.json` file:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ./path/to/marketplace.json
```

### [​](#add-from-remote-urls) Add from remote URLs

Add a remote `marketplace.json` file via URL:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://example.com/marketplace.json
```

URL-based marketplaces have some limitations compared to Git-based marketplaces. If you encounter “path not found” errors when installing plugins, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#plugins-with-relative-paths-fail-in-url-based-marketplaces).

## [​](#install-plugins) Install plugins

Once you’ve added marketplaces, you can install plugins directly (installs to user scope by default):

```bash
/plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

To choose a different [installation scope](/docs/en/settings#configuration-scopes), use the interactive UI: run `/plugin`, go to the **Discover** tab, and press **Enter** on a plugin. You’ll see options for:

- **User scope** (default): install for yourself across all projects
- **Project scope**: install for all collaborators on this repository (adds to `.claude/settings.json`)
- **Local scope**: install for yourself in this repository only (not shared with collaborators)

You may also see plugins with **managed** scope—these are installed by administrators via [managed settings](/docs/en/settings#settings-files) and cannot be modified.
Run `/plugin` and go to the **Installed** tab to see your plugins grouped by scope.

Make sure you trust a plugin before installing it. Anthropic does not control what MCP servers, files, or other software are included in plugins and cannot verify that they work as intended. Check each plugin’s homepage for more information.

## [​](#manage-installed-plugins) Manage installed plugins

Run `/plugin` and go to the **Installed** tab to view, enable, disable, or uninstall your plugins.
You can also manage plugins with direct commands.
Disable a plugin without uninstalling:

```bash
/plugin disable plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

Re-enable a disabled plugin:

```bash
/plugin enable plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

Completely remove a plugin:

```bash
/plugin uninstall plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

The `--scope` option lets you target a specific scope with CLI commands:

```bash
claude plugin install formatter@your-org --scope project
claude plugin uninstall formatter@your-org --scope project
```

## [​](#manage-marketplaces) Manage marketplaces

You can manage marketplaces through the interactive `/plugin` interface or with CLI commands.

### [​](#use-the-interactive-interface) Use the interactive interface

Run `/plugin` and go to the **Marketplaces** tab to:

- View all your added marketplaces with their sources and status
- Add new marketplaces
- Update marketplace listings to fetch the latest plugins
- Remove marketplaces you no longer need

### [​](#use-cli-commands) Use CLI commands

You can also manage marketplaces with direct commands.
List all configured marketplaces:

```bash
/plugin marketplace list
```

Refresh plugin listings from a marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace update marketplace-name
```

Remove a marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace remove marketplace-name
```

Removing a marketplace will uninstall any plugins you installed from it.

### [​](#configure-auto-updates) Configure auto-updates

Claude Code can automatically update marketplaces and their installed plugins at startup. When auto-update is enabled for a marketplace, Claude Code refreshes the marketplace data and updates installed plugins to their latest versions. If any plugins were updated, you’ll see a notification suggesting you restart Claude Code.
Toggle auto-update for individual marketplaces through the UI:

1. Run `/plugin` to open the plugin manager
2. Select **Marketplaces**
3. Choose a marketplace from the list
4. Select **Enable auto-update** or **Disable auto-update**

Official Anthropic marketplaces have auto-update enabled by default. Third-party and local development marketplaces have auto-update disabled by default.
To disable all automatic updates entirely for both Claude Code and all plugins, set the `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` environment variable. See [Auto updates](/docs/en/setup#auto-updates) for details.
To keep plugin auto-updates enabled while disabling Claude Code auto-updates, set `FORCE_AUTOUPDATE_PLUGINS=true` along with `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER`:

```bash
export DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=true
export FORCE_AUTOUPDATE_PLUGINS=true
```

This is useful when you want to manage Claude Code updates manually but still receive automatic plugin updates.

## [​](#configure-team-marketplaces) Configure team marketplaces

Team admins can set up automatic marketplace installation for projects by adding marketplace configuration to `.claude/settings.json`. When team members trust the repository folder, Claude Code prompts them to install these marketplaces and plugins.
For full configuration options including `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `enabledPlugins`, see [Plugin settings](/docs/en/settings#plugin-settings).

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

### [​](#/plugin-command-not-recognized) /plugin command not recognized

If you see “unknown command” or the `/plugin` command doesn’t appear:

1. **Check your version**: Run `claude --version`. Plugins require version 1.0.33 or later.
2. **Update Claude Code**:
   - **Homebrew**: `brew upgrade claude-code`
   - **npm**: `npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
   - **Native installer**: Re-run the install command from [Setup](/docs/en/setup)
3. **Restart Claude Code**: After updating, restart your terminal and run `claude` again.

### [​](#common-issues) Common issues

- **Marketplace not loading**: Verify the URL is accessible and that `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` exists at the path
- **Plugin installation failures**: Check that plugin source URLs are accessible and repositories are public (or you have access)
- **Files not found after installation**: Plugins are copied to a cache, so paths referencing files outside the plugin directory won’t work
- **Plugin Skills not appearing**: Clear the cache with `rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache`, restart Claude Code, and reinstall the plugin. See [Plugin Skills not appearing](/docs/en/skills#plugin-skills-not-appearing-after-installation) for details.

For detailed troubleshooting with solutions, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#troubleshooting) in the marketplace guide. For debugging tools, see [Debugging and development tools](/docs/en/plugins-reference#debugging-and-development-tools).

This GitHub Action allows you to run Claude Code within your GitHub Actions workflows. You can use this to build any custom workflow on top of Claude Code.
[View repository →](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action)

## [​](#setup) Setup

## [​](#quick-setup) Quick setup

The easiest way to set up this action is through Claude Code in the terminal. Just open claude and run `/install-github-app`.
This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.

- You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets
- The GitHub app will request read & write permissions for Contents, Issues, and Pull requests
- This quickstart method is only available for direct Claude API users. If
  you’re using AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI, please see the [Using with AWS
  Bedrock & Google Vertex AI](#using-with-aws-bedrock-%26-google-vertex-ai)
  section.

## [​](#manual-setup) Manual setup

If the `/install-github-app` command fails or you prefer manual setup, please follow these manual setup instructions:

1. **Install the Claude GitHub app** to your repository: <https://github.com/apps/claude>
   The Claude GitHub app requires the following repository permissions:
   - **Contents**: Read & write (to modify repository files)
   - **Issues**: Read & write (to respond to issues)
   - **Pull requests**: Read & write (to create PRs and push changes)For more details on security and permissions, see the [security documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/security.md).
2. **Add ANTHROPIC\_API\_KEY** to your repository secrets ([Learn how to use secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions))
3. **Copy the workflow file** from [examples/claude.yml](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/examples/claude.yml) into your repository’s `.github/workflows/`

After completing either the quickstart or manual setup, test the action by tagging `@claude` in an issue or PR comment.

## [​](#upgrading-from-beta) Upgrading from Beta

Claude Code GitHub Actions v1.0 introduces breaking changes that require updating your workflow files in order to upgrade to v1.0 from the beta version.

If you’re currently using the beta version of Claude Code GitHub Actions, we recommend that you update your workflows to use the GA version. The new version simplifies configuration while adding powerful new features like automatic mode detection.

### [​](#essential-changes) Essential changes

All beta users must make these changes to their workflow files in order to upgrade:

1. **Update the action version**: Change `@beta` to `@v1`
2. **Remove mode configuration**: Delete `mode: "tag"` or `mode: "agent"` (now auto-detected)
3. **Update prompt inputs**: Replace `direct_prompt` with `prompt`
4. **Move CLI options**: Convert `max_turns`, `model`, `custom_instructions`, etc. to `claude_args`

### [​](#breaking-changes-reference) Breaking Changes Reference

| Old Beta Input | New v1.0 Input |
| --- | --- |
| `mode` | *(Removed - auto-detected)* |
| `direct_prompt` | `prompt` |
| `override_prompt` | `prompt` with GitHub variables |
| `custom_instructions` | `claude_args: --system-prompt` |
| `max_turns` | `claude_args: --max-turns` |
| `model` | `claude_args: --model` |
| `allowed_tools` | `claude_args: --allowedTools` |
| `disallowed_tools` | `claude_args: --disallowedTools` |
| `claude_env` | `settings` JSON format |

### [​](#before-and-after-example) Before and After Example

**Beta version:**

```bash
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    mode: "tag"
    direct_prompt: "Review this PR for security issues"
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    custom_instructions: "Follow our coding standards"
    max_turns: "10"
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
```

**GA version (v1.0):**

```bash
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    prompt: "Review this PR for security issues"
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    claude_args: |
      --system-prompt "Follow our coding standards"
      --max-turns 10
      --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

The action now automatically detects whether to run in interactive mode (responds to `@claude` mentions) or automation mode (runs immediately with a prompt) based on your configuration.

## [​](#best-practices) Best practices

### [​](#claude-md-configuration) CLAUDE.md configuration

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your repository root to define code style guidelines, review criteria, project-specific rules, and preferred patterns. This file guides Claude’s understanding of your project standards.

### [​](#security-considerations) Security considerations

Never commit API keys directly to your repository.

For comprehensive security guidance including permissions, authentication, and best practices, see the [Claude Code Action security documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/security.md).
Always use GitHub Secrets for API keys:

- Add your API key as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Reference it in workflows: `anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`
- Limit action permissions to only what’s necessary
- Review Claude’s suggestions before merging

Always use GitHub Secrets (for example, `${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`) rather than hardcoding API keys directly in your workflow files.

### [​](#optimizing-performance) Optimizing performance

Use issue templates to provide context, keep your `CLAUDE.md` concise and focused, and configure appropriate timeouts for your workflows.

### [​](#ci-costs) CI costs

When using Claude Code GitHub Actions, be aware of the associated costs:
**GitHub Actions costs:**

- Claude Code runs on GitHub-hosted runners, which consume your GitHub Actions minutes
- See [GitHub’s billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) for detailed pricing and minute limits

**API costs:**

- Each Claude interaction consumes API tokens based on the length of prompts and responses
- Token usage varies by task complexity and codebase size
- See [Claude’s pricing page](https://claude.com/platform/api) for current token rates

**Cost optimization tips:**

- Use specific `@claude` commands to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Configure appropriate `--max-turns` in `claude_args` to prevent excessive iterations
- Set workflow-level timeouts to avoid runaway jobs
- Consider using GitHub’s concurrency controls to limit parallel runs

## [​](#configuration-examples) Configuration examples

The Claude Code Action v1 simplifies configuration with unified parameters:

```bash
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    prompt: "Your instructions here" # Optional
    claude_args: "--max-turns 5" # Optional CLI arguments
```

Key features:

- **Unified prompt interface** - Use `prompt` for all instructions
- **Slash commands** - Pre-built prompts like `/review` or `/fix`
- **CLI passthrough** - Any Claude Code CLI argument via `claude_args`
- **Flexible triggers** - Works with any GitHub event

Visit the [examples directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples) for complete workflow files.

When responding to issue or PR comments, Claude automatically responds to @claude mentions. For other events, use the `prompt` parameter to provide instructions.

## [​](#using-with-aws-bedrock-&-google-vertex-ai) Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI

For enterprise environments, you can use Claude Code GitHub Actions with your own cloud infrastructure. This approach gives you control over data residency and billing while maintaining the same functionality.

### [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

Before setting up Claude Code GitHub Actions with cloud providers, you need:

#### [​](#for-google-cloud-vertex-ai:) For Google Cloud Vertex AI:

1. A Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled
2. Workload Identity Federation configured for GitHub Actions
3. A service account with the required permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB\_TOKEN

#### [​](#for-aws-bedrock:) For AWS Bedrock:

1. An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock enabled
2. GitHub OIDC Identity Provider configured in AWS
3. An IAM role with Bedrock permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB\_TOKEN

1

Create a custom GitHub App (Recommended for 3P Providers)

For best control and security when using 3P providers like Vertex AI or Bedrock, we recommend creating your own GitHub App:

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/apps/new>
2. Fill in the basic information:
   - **GitHub App name**: Choose a unique name (e.g., “YourOrg Claude Assistant”)
   - **Homepage URL**: Your organization’s website or the repository URL
3. Configure the app settings:
   - **Webhooks**: Uncheck “Active” (not needed for this integration)
4. Set the required permissions:
   - **Repository permissions**:
     - Contents: Read & Write
     - Issues: Read & Write
     - Pull requests: Read & Write
5. Click “Create GitHub App”
6. After creation, click “Generate a private key” and save the downloaded `.pem` file
7. Note your App ID from the app settings page
8. Install the app to your repository:
   - From your app’s settings page, click “Install App” in the left sidebar
   - Select your account or organization
   - Choose “Only select repositories” and select the specific repository
   - Click “Install”
9. Add the private key as a secret to your repository:
   - Go to your repository’s Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Create a new secret named `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` with the contents of the `.pem` file
10. Add the App ID as a secret:

- Create a new secret named `APP_ID` with your GitHub App’s ID

This app will be used with the [actions/create-github-app-token](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token) action to generate authentication tokens in your workflows.

**Alternative for Claude API or if you don’t want to setup your own Github app**: Use the official Anthropic app:

1. Install from: <https://github.com/apps/claude>
2. No additional configuration needed for authentication

2

Configure cloud provider authentication

Choose your cloud provider and set up secure authentication:

AWS Bedrock

**Configure AWS to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate securely without storing credentials.**
> **Security Note**: Use repository-specific configurations and grant only the minimum required permissions.

**Required Setup**:

1. **Enable Amazon Bedrock**:
   - Request access to Claude models in Amazon Bedrock
   - For cross-region models, request access in all required regions
2. **Set up GitHub OIDC Identity Provider**:
   - Provider URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
   - Audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`
3. **Create IAM Role for GitHub Actions**:
   - Trusted entity type: Web identity
   - Identity provider: `token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
   - Permissions: `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` policy
   - Configure trust policy for your specific repository

**Required Values**:After setup, you’ll need:

- **AWS\_ROLE\_TO\_ASSUME**: The ARN of the IAM role you created

OIDC is more secure than using static AWS access keys because credentials are temporary and automatically rotated.

See [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) for detailed OIDC setup instructions.

Google Vertex AI

**Configure Google Cloud to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate securely without storing credentials.**
> **Security Note**: Use repository-specific configurations and grant only the minimum required permissions.

**Required Setup**:

1. **Enable APIs** in your Google Cloud project:
   - IAM Credentials API
   - Security Token Service (STS) API
   - Vertex AI API
2. **Create Workload Identity Federation resources**:
   - Create a Workload Identity Pool
   - Add a GitHub OIDC provider with:
     - Issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
     - Attribute mappings for repository and owner
     - **Security recommendation**: Use repository-specific attribute conditions
3. **Create a Service Account**:
   - Grant only `Vertex AI User` role
   - **Security recommendation**: Create a dedicated service account per repository
4. **Configure IAM bindings**:
   - Allow the Workload Identity Pool to impersonate the service account
   - **Security recommendation**: Use repository-specific principal sets

**Required Values**:After setup, you’ll need:

- **GCP\_WORKLOAD\_IDENTITY\_PROVIDER**: The full provider resource name
- **GCP\_SERVICE\_ACCOUNT**: The service account email address

Workload Identity Federation eliminates the need for downloadable service account keys, improving security.

For detailed setup instructions, consult the [Google Cloud Workload Identity Federation documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation).

3

Add Required Secrets

Add the following secrets to your repository (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

#### [​](#for-claude-api-direct-:) For Claude API (Direct):

1. **For API Authentication**:
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Claude API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. **For GitHub App (if using your own app)**:
   - `APP_ID`: Your GitHub App’s ID
   - `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key (.pem) content

#### [​](#for-google-cloud-vertex-ai) For Google Cloud Vertex AI

1. **For GCP Authentication**:
   - `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`
   - `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
2. **For GitHub App (if using your own app)**:
   - `APP_ID`: Your GitHub App’s ID
   - `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key (.pem) content

#### [​](#for-aws-bedrock) For AWS Bedrock

1. **For AWS Authentication**:
   - `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME`
2. **For GitHub App (if using your own app)**:
   - `APP_ID`: Your GitHub App’s ID
   - `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key (.pem) content

          CLOUD_ML_REGION: us-east5
          VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_3_7_SONNET: us-east5
```

The project ID is automatically retrieved from the Google Cloud authentication step, so you don’t need to hardcode it.

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

### [​](#claude-not-responding-to-@claude-commands) Claude not responding to @claude commands

Verify the GitHub App is installed correctly, check that workflows are enabled, ensure API key is set in repository secrets, and confirm the comment contains `@claude` (not `/claude`).

### [​](#ci-not-running-on-claude’s-commits) CI not running on Claude’s commits

Ensure you’re using the GitHub App or custom app (not Actions user), check workflow triggers include the necessary events, and verify app permissions include CI triggers.

### [​](#authentication-errors) Authentication errors

Confirm API key is valid and has sufficient permissions. For Bedrock/Vertex, check credentials configuration and ensure secrets are named correctly in workflows.

## [​](#advanced-configuration) Advanced configuration

### [​](#action-parameters) Action parameters

The Claude Code Action v1 uses a simplified configuration:

| Parameter | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prompt` | Instructions for Claude (text or slash command) | No\* |
| `claude_args` | CLI arguments passed to Claude Code | No |
| `anthropic_api_key` | Claude API key | Yes\*\* |
| `github_token` | GitHub token for API access | No |
| `trigger_phrase` | Custom trigger phrase (default: “@claude”) | No |
| `use_bedrock` | Use AWS Bedrock instead of Claude API | No |
| `use_vertex` | Use Google Vertex AI instead of Claude API | No |

\*Prompt is optional - when omitted for issue/PR comments, Claude responds to trigger phrase
\*\*Required for direct Claude API, not for Bedrock/Vertex

#### [​](#pass-cli-arguments) Pass CLI arguments

The `claude_args` parameter accepts any Claude Code CLI arguments:

```bash
claude_args: "--max-turns 5 --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 --mcp-config /path/to/config.json"
```

Common arguments:

- `--max-turns`: Maximum conversation turns (default: 10)
- `--model`: Model to use (for example, `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)
- `--mcp-config`: Path to MCP configuration
- `--allowed-tools`: Comma-separated list of allowed tools
- `--debug`: Enable debug output

### [​](#alternative-integration-methods) Alternative integration methods

While the `/install-github-app` command is the recommended approach, you can also:

- **Custom GitHub App**: For organizations needing branded usernames or custom authentication flows. Create your own GitHub App with required permissions (contents, issues, pull requests) and use the actions/create-github-app-token action to generate tokens in your workflows.
- **Manual GitHub Actions**: Direct workflow configuration for maximum flexibility
- **MCP Configuration**: Dynamic loading of Model Context Protocol servers

See the [Claude Code Action documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs) for detailed guides on authentication, security, and advanced configuration.

### [​](#customizing-claude’s-behavior) Customizing Claude’s behavior

You can configure Claude’s behavior in two ways:

1. **CLAUDE.md**: Define coding standards, review criteria, and project-specific rules in a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your repository. Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests. Check out our [Memory documentation](/docs/en/memory) for more details.
2. **Custom prompts**: Use the `prompt` parameter in the workflow file to provide workflow-specific instructions. This allows you to customize Claude’s behavior for different workflows or tasks.

Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests.

title: Claude Code GitLab CI/CD
---

Claude Code for GitLab CI/CD is currently in beta. Features and functionality may evolve as we refine the experience.This integration is maintained by GitLab. For support, see the following [GitLab issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/573776).

This integration is built on top of the [Claude Code CLI and SDK](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agent-sdk), enabling programmatic use of Claude in your CI/CD jobs and custom automation workflows.

## [​](#why-use-claude-code-with-gitlab) Why use Claude Code with GitLab?

- **Instant MR creation**: Describe what you need, and Claude proposes a complete MR with changes and explanation
- **Automated implementation**: Turn issues into working code with a single command or mention
- **Project-aware**: Claude follows your `CLAUDE.md` guidelines and existing code patterns
- **Simple setup**: Add one job to `.gitlab-ci.yml` and a masked CI/CD variable
- **Enterprise-ready**: Choose Claude API, AWS Bedrock, or Google Vertex AI to meet data residency and procurement needs
- **Secure by default**: Runs in your GitLab runners with your branch protection and approvals

## [​](#how-it-works) How it works

Claude Code uses GitLab CI/CD to run AI tasks in isolated jobs and commit results back via MRs:

1. **Event-driven orchestration**: GitLab listens for your chosen triggers (for example, a comment that mentions `@claude` in an issue, MR, or review thread). The job collects context from the thread and repository, builds prompts from that input, and runs Claude Code.
2. **Provider abstraction**: Use the provider that fits your environment:
   - Claude API (SaaS)
   - AWS Bedrock (IAM-based access, cross-region options)
   - Google Vertex AI (GCP-native, Workload Identity Federation)
3. **Sandboxed execution**: Each interaction runs in a container with strict network and filesystem rules. Claude Code enforces workspace-scoped permissions to constrain writes. Every change flows through an MR so reviewers see the diff and approvals still apply.

Pick regional endpoints to reduce latency and meet data-sovereignty requirements while using existing cloud agreements.

## [​](#what-can-claude-do) What can Claude do?

Claude Code enables powerful CI/CD workflows that transform how you work with code:

- Create and update MRs from issue descriptions or comments
- Analyze performance regressions and propose optimizations
- Implement features directly in a branch, then open an MR
- Fix bugs and regressions identified by tests or comments
- Respond to follow-up comments to iterate on requested changes

## [​](#setup) Setup

### [​](#quick-setup) Quick setup

The fastest way to get started is to add a minimal job to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` and set your API key as a masked variable.

1. **Add a masked CI/CD variable**
   - Go to **Settings** → **CI/CD** → **Variables**
   - Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (masked, protected as needed)
2. **Add a Claude job to `.gitlab-ci.yml`**

```bash
stages:
  - ai

claude:
  stage: ai
  image: node:24-alpine3.21
  # Adjust rules to fit how you want to trigger the job:
  # - manual runs
  # - merge request events
  # - web/API triggers when a comment contains '@claude'
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "web"'
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'
  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: fetch
  before_script:
    - apk update
    - apk add --no-cache git curl bash
    - curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
  script:
    # Optional: start a GitLab MCP server if your setup provides one
    - /bin/gitlab-mcp-server || true
    # Use AI_FLOW_* variables when invoking via web/API triggers with context payloads
    - echo "$AI_FLOW_INPUT for $AI_FLOW_CONTEXT on $AI_FLOW_EVENT"
    - >
      claude
      -p "${AI_FLOW_INPUT:-'Review this MR and implement the requested changes'}"
      --permission-mode acceptEdits
      --allowedTools "Bash(*) Read(*) Edit(*) Write(*) mcp__gitlab"
      --debug
```

After adding the job and your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` variable, test by running the job manually from **CI/CD** → **Pipelines**, or trigger it from an MR to let Claude propose updates in a branch and open an MR if needed.

To run on AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI instead of the Claude API, see the [Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI](#using-with-aws-bedrock--google-vertex-ai) section below for authentication and environment setup.

### [​](#manual-setup-recommended-for-production) Manual setup (recommended for production)

If you prefer a more controlled setup or need enterprise providers:

1. **Configure provider access**:
   - **Claude API**: Create and store `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a masked CI/CD variable
   - **AWS Bedrock**: **Configure GitLab** → **AWS OIDC** and create an IAM role for Bedrock
   - **Google Vertex AI**: **Configure Workload Identity Federation for GitLab** → **GCP**
2. **Add project credentials for GitLab API operations**:
   - Use `CI_JOB_TOKEN` by default, or create a Project Access Token with `api` scope
   - Store as `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN` (masked) if using a PAT
3. **Add the Claude job to `.gitlab-ci.yml`** (see examples below)
4. **(Optional) Enable mention-driven triggers**:
   - Add a project webhook for “Comments (notes)” to your event listener (if you use one)
   - Have the listener call the pipeline trigger API with variables like `AI_FLOW_INPUT` and `AI_FLOW_CONTEXT` when a comment contains `@claude`

## [​](#example-use-cases) Example use cases

### [​](#turn-issues-into-mrs) Turn issues into MRs

In an issue comment:

```bash
@claude implement this feature based on the issue description
```

Claude analyzes the issue and codebase, writes changes in a branch, and opens an MR for review.

### [​](#get-implementation-help) Get implementation help

In an MR discussion:

```bash
@claude suggest a concrete approach to cache the results of this API call
```

Claude proposes changes, adds code with appropriate caching, and updates the MR.

### [​](#fix-bugs-quickly) Fix bugs quickly

In an issue or MR comment:

```bash
@claude fix the TypeError in the user dashboard component
```

Claude locates the bug, implements a fix, and updates the branch or opens a new MR.

## [​](#using-with-aws-bedrock-&-google-vertex-ai) Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI

For enterprise environments, you can run Claude Code entirely on your cloud infrastructure with the same developer experience.

- AWS Bedrock
- Google Vertex AI

### [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

Before setting up Claude Code with AWS Bedrock, you need:

1. An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock access to the desired Claude models
2. GitLab configured as an OIDC identity provider in AWS IAM
3. An IAM role with Bedrock permissions and a trust policy restricted to your GitLab project/refs
4. GitLab CI/CD variables for role assumption:
   - `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` (role ARN)
   - `AWS_REGION` (Bedrock region)

### [​](#setup-instructions) Setup instructions

Configure AWS to allow GitLab CI jobs to assume an IAM role via OIDC (no static keys).**Required setup:**

1. Enable Amazon Bedrock and request access to your target Claude models
2. Create an IAM OIDC provider for GitLab if not already present
3. Create an IAM role trusted by the GitLab OIDC provider, restricted to your project and protected refs
4. Attach least-privilege permissions for Bedrock invoke APIs

**Required values to store in CI/CD variables:**

- `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME`
- `AWS_REGION`

Add variables in Settings → CI/CD → Variables:

```bash
# For AWS Bedrock:
- AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME
- AWS_REGION
```

Use the AWS Bedrock job example above to exchange the GitLab job token for temporary AWS credentials at runtime.

### [​](#prerequisites-2) Prerequisites

Before setting up Claude Code with Google Vertex AI, you need:

1. A Google Cloud project with:
   - Vertex AI API enabled
   - Workload Identity Federation configured to trust GitLab OIDC
2. A dedicated service account with only the required Vertex AI roles
3. GitLab CI/CD variables for WIF:
   - `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` (full resource name)
   - `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` (service account email)

### [​](#setup-instructions-2) Setup instructions

Configure Google Cloud to allow GitLab CI jobs to impersonate a service account via Workload Identity Federation.**Required setup:**

1. Enable IAM Credentials API, STS API, and Vertex AI API
2. Create a Workload Identity Pool and provider for GitLab OIDC
3. Create a dedicated service account with Vertex AI roles
4. Grant the WIF principal permission to impersonate the service account

**Required values to store in CI/CD variables:**

- `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`
- `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`

Add variables in Settings → CI/CD → Variables:

```bash
# For Google Vertex AI:
- GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER
- GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
- CLOUD_ML_REGION (for example, us-east5)
```

Use the Google Vertex AI job example above to authenticate without storing keys.

      --allowedTools "Bash(*) Read(*) Edit(*) Write(*) mcp__gitlab"
      --debug
  variables:
    AWS_REGION: "us-west-2"
```

Model IDs for Bedrock include region-specific prefixes and version suffixes (for example, `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0`). Pass the desired model via your job configuration or prompt if your workflow supports it.

### [​](#google-vertex-ai-job-example-workload-identity-federation) Google Vertex AI job example (Workload Identity Federation)

**Prerequisites:**

- Vertex AI API enabled in your GCP project
- Workload Identity Federation configured to trust GitLab OIDC
- A service account with Vertex AI permissions

**Required CI/CD variables:**

- `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`: Full provider resource name
- `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: Service account email
- `CLOUD_ML_REGION`: Vertex region (for example, `us-east5`)

```bash

      --allowedTools "Bash(*) Read(*) Edit(*) Write(*) mcp__gitlab"
      --debug
  variables:
    CLOUD_ML_REGION: "us-east5"
```

With Workload Identity Federation, you do not need to store service account keys. Use repository-specific trust conditions and least-privilege service accounts.

## [​](#best-practices) Best practices

### [​](#claude-md-configuration) CLAUDE.md configuration

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the repository root to define coding standards, review criteria, and project-specific rules. Claude reads this file during runs and follows your conventions when proposing changes.

### [​](#security-considerations) Security considerations

**Never commit API keys or cloud credentials to your repository**. Always use GitLab CI/CD variables:

- Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a masked variable (and protect it if needed)
- Use provider-specific OIDC where possible (no long-lived keys)
- Limit job permissions and network egress
- Review Claude’s MRs like any other contributor

### [​](#optimizing-performance) Optimizing performance

- Keep `CLAUDE.md` focused and concise
- Provide clear issue/MR descriptions to reduce iterations
- Configure sensible job timeouts to avoid runaway runs
- Cache npm and package installs in runners where possible

### [​](#ci-costs) CI costs

When using Claude Code with GitLab CI/CD, be aware of associated costs:

- **GitLab Runner time**:
  - Claude runs on your GitLab runners and consumes compute minutes
  - See your GitLab plan’s runner billing for details
- **API costs**:
  - Each Claude interaction consumes tokens based on prompt and response size
  - Token usage varies by task complexity and codebase size
  - See [Anthropic pricing](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing) for details
- **Cost optimization tips**:
  - Use specific `@claude` commands to reduce unnecessary turns
  - Set appropriate `max_turns` and job timeout values
  - Limit concurrency to control parallel runs

## [​](#security-and-governance) Security and governance

- Each job runs in an isolated container with restricted network access
- Claude’s changes flow through MRs so reviewers see every diff
- Branch protection and approval rules apply to AI-generated code
- Claude Code uses workspace-scoped permissions to constrain writes
- Costs remain under your control because you bring your own provider credentials

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

### [​](#claude-not-responding-to-@claude-commands) Claude not responding to @claude commands

- Verify your pipeline is being triggered (manually, MR event, or via a note event listener/webhook)
- Ensure CI/CD variables (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or cloud provider settings) are present and unmasked
- Check that the comment contains `@claude` (not `/claude`) and that your mention trigger is configured

### [​](#job-can’t-write-comments-or-open-mrs) Job can’t write comments or open MRs

- Ensure `CI_JOB_TOKEN` has sufficient permissions for the project, or use a Project Access Token with `api` scope
- Check the `mcp__gitlab` tool is enabled in `--allowedTools`
- Confirm the job runs in the context of the MR or has enough context via `AI_FLOW_*` variables

### [​](#authentication-errors) Authentication errors

- **For Claude API**: Confirm `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is valid and unexpired
- **For Bedrock/Vertex**: Verify OIDC/WIF configuration, role impersonation, and secret names; confirm region and model availability

## [​](#advanced-configuration) Advanced configuration

### [​](#common-parameters-and-variables) Common parameters and variables

Claude Code supports these commonly used inputs:

- `prompt` / `prompt_file`: Provide instructions inline (`-p`) or via a file
- `max_turns`: Limit the number of back-and-forth iterations
- `timeout_minutes`: Limit total execution time
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Required for the Claude API (not used for Bedrock/Vertex)
- Provider-specific environment: `AWS_REGION`, project/region vars for Vertex

Exact flags and parameters may vary by version of `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`. Run `claude --help` in your job to see supported options.

### [​](#customizing-claude’s-behavior) Customizing Claude’s behavior

You can guide Claude in two primary ways:

1. **CLAUDE.md**: Define coding standards, security requirements, and project conventions. Claude reads this during runs and follows your rules.
2. **Custom prompts**: Pass task-specific instructions via `prompt`/`prompt_file` in the job. Use different prompts for different jobs (for example, review, implement, refactor).

## [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

Before configuring Claude Code with Vertex AI, ensure you have:

- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with billing enabled
- A GCP project with Vertex AI API enabled
- Access to desired Claude models (for example, Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) installed and configured
- Quota allocated in desired GCP region

## [​](#region-configuration) Region Configuration

Claude Code can be used with both Vertex AI [global](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/global-endpoint-for-claude-models-generally-available-on-vertex-ai) and regional endpoints.

Vertex AI may not support the Claude Code default models on all regions. You may need to switch to a [supported region or model](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations#genai-partner-models).

Vertex AI may not support the Claude Code default models on global endpoints. You may need to switch to a regional endpoint or [supported model](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-partner-models#supported_models).

## [​](#setup) Setup

### [​](#1-enable-vertex-ai-api) 1. Enable Vertex AI API

Enable the Vertex AI API in your GCP project:

```bash
# Set your project ID
gcloud config set project YOUR-PROJECT-ID

# Enable Vertex AI API
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

### [​](#2-request-model-access) 2. Request model access

Request access to Claude models in Vertex AI:

1. Navigate to the [Vertex AI Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden)
2. Search for “Claude” models
3. Request access to desired Claude models (for example, Claude Sonnet 4.5)
4. Wait for approval (may take 24-48 hours)

### [​](#3-configure-gcp-credentials) 3. Configure GCP credentials

Claude Code uses standard Google Cloud authentication.
For more information, see [Google Cloud authentication documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication).

When authenticating, Claude Code will automatically use the project ID from the `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` environment variable. To override this, set one of these environment variables: `GCLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.

### [​](#4-configure-claude-code) 4. Configure Claude Code

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Enable Vertex AI integration
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
export CLOUD_ML_REGION=global
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=YOUR-PROJECT-ID

# Optional: Disable prompt caching if needed
export DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1

# When CLOUD_ML_REGION=global, override region for unsupported models
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_3_5_HAIKU=us-east5

# Optional: Override regions for other specific models
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_3_5_SONNET=us-east5
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_3_7_SONNET=us-east5
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_4_0_OPUS=europe-west1
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_4_0_SONNET=us-east5
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_4_1_OPUS=europe-west1
```

[Prompt caching](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) is automatically supported when you specify the `cache_control` ephemeral flag. To disable it, set `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1`. For heightened rate limits, contact Google Cloud support.

When using Vertex AI, the `/login` and `/logout` commands are disabled since authentication is handled through Google Cloud credentials.

### [​](#5-model-configuration) 5. Model configuration

Claude Code uses these default models for Vertex AI:

| Model type | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary model | `claude-sonnet-4-5@20250929` |
| Small/fast model | `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001` |

For Vertex AI users, Claude Code will not automatically upgrade from Haiku 3.5 to Haiku 4.5. To manually switch to a newer Haiku model, set the `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` environment variable to the full model name (for example, `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001`).

To customize models:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL='claude-opus-4-1@20250805'
export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL='claude-haiku-4-5@20251001'
```

## [​](#iam-configuration) IAM configuration

Assign the required IAM permissions:
The `roles/aiplatform.user` role includes the required permissions:

- `aiplatform.endpoints.predict` - Required for model invocation and token counting

For more restrictive permissions, create a custom role with only the permissions above.
For details, see [Vertex IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control).

We recommend creating a dedicated GCP project for Claude Code to simplify cost tracking and access control.

## [​](#1m-token-context-window) 1M token context window

Claude Sonnet 4 and Sonnet 4.5 support the [1M token context window](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) on Vertex AI.

The 1M token context window is currently in beta. To use the extended context window, include the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header in your Vertex AI requests.

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

If you encounter quota issues:

- Check current quotas or request quota increase through [Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/view-manage)

If you encounter “model not found” 404 errors:

- Confirm model is Enabled in [Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden)
- Verify you have access to the specified region
- If using `CLOUD_ML_REGION=global`, check that your models support global endpoints in [Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) under “Supported features”. For models that don’t support global endpoints, either:
  - Specify a supported model via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` or `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL`, or
  - Set a regional endpoint using `VERTEX_REGION_<MODEL_NAME>` environment variables

If you encounter 429 errors:

- For regional endpoints, ensure the primary model and small/fast model are supported in your selected region
- Consider switching to `CLOUD_ML_REGION=global` for better availability

title: Run Claude Code programmatically
---

The [Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) gives you the same tools, agent loop, and context management that power Claude Code. It’s available as a CLI for scripts and CI/CD, or as [Python](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/python) and [TypeScript](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript) packages for full programmatic control.

The CLI was previously called “headless mode.” The `-p` flag and all CLI options work the same way.

To run Claude Code programmatically from the CLI, pass `-p` with your prompt and any [CLI options](/docs/en/cli-reference):

```bash
claude -p "Find and fix the bug in auth.py" --allowedTools "Read,Edit,Bash"
```

This page covers using the Agent SDK via the CLI (`claude -p`). For the Python and TypeScript SDK packages with structured outputs, tool approval callbacks, and native message objects, see the [full Agent SDK documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview).

## [​](#basic-usage) Basic usage

Add the `-p` (or `--print`) flag to any `claude` command to run it non-interactively. All [CLI options](/docs/en/cli-reference) work with `-p`, including:

- `--continue` for [continuing conversations](#continue-conversations)
- `--allowedTools` for [auto-approving tools](#auto-approve-tools)
- `--output-format` for [structured output](#get-structured-output)

This example asks Claude a question about your codebase and prints the response:

```bash
claude -p "What does the auth module do?"
```

## [​](#examples) Examples

These examples highlight common CLI patterns.

### [​](#get-structured-output) Get structured output

Use `--output-format` to control how responses are returned:

- `text` (default): plain text output
- `json`: structured JSON with result, session ID, and metadata
- `stream-json`: newline-delimited JSON for real-time streaming

This example returns a project summary as JSON with session metadata, with the text result in the `result` field:

```bash
claude -p "Summarize this project" --output-format json
```

To get output conforming to a specific schema, use `--output-format json` with `--json-schema` and a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) definition. The response includes metadata about the request (session ID, usage, etc.) with the structured output in the `structured_output` field.
This example extracts function names and returns them as an array of strings:

```bash
claude -p "Extract the main function names from auth.py" \
  --output-format json \
  --json-schema '{"type":"object","properties":{"functions":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["functions"]}'
```

Use a tool like [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to parse the response and extract specific fields:

```bash
# Extract the text result
claude -p "Summarize this project" --output-format json | jq -r '.result'

# Extract structured output
claude -p "Extract function names from auth.py" \
  --output-format json \
  --json-schema '{"type":"object","properties":{"functions":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["functions"]}' \
  | jq '.structured_output'
```

### [​](#auto-approve-tools) Auto-approve tools

Use `--allowedTools` to let Claude use certain tools without prompting. This example runs a test suite and fixes failures, allowing Claude to execute Bash commands and read/edit files without asking for permission:

```bash
claude -p "Run the test suite and fix any failures" \
  --allowedTools "Bash,Read,Edit"
```

### [​](#create-a-commit) Create a commit

This example reviews staged changes and creates a commit with an appropriate message:

```bash
claude -p "Look at my staged changes and create an appropriate commit" \
  --allowedTools "Bash(git diff:*),Bash(git log:*),Bash(git status:*),Bash(git commit:*)"
```

The `--allowedTools` flag uses [permission rule syntax](/docs/en/settings#permission-rule-syntax). The `:*` suffix enables prefix matching, so `Bash(git diff:*)` allows any command starting with `git diff`.

[Slash commands](/docs/en/slash-commands) like `/commit` are only available in interactive mode. In `-p` mode, describe the task you want to accomplish instead.

### [​](#customize-the-system-prompt) Customize the system prompt

Use `--append-system-prompt` to add instructions while keeping Claude Code’s default behavior. This example pipes a PR diff to Claude and instructs it to review for security vulnerabilities:

```bash
gh pr diff "$1" | claude -p \
  --append-system-prompt "You are a security engineer. Review for vulnerabilities." \
  --output-format json
```

See [system prompt flags](/docs/en/cli-reference#system-prompt-flags) for more options including `--system-prompt` to fully replace the default prompt.

### [​](#continue-conversations) Continue conversations

Use `--continue` to continue the most recent conversation, or `--resume` with a session ID to continue a specific conversation. This example runs a review, then sends follow-up prompts:

```bash
# First request
claude -p "Review this codebase for performance issues"

# Continue the most recent conversation
claude -p "Now focus on the database queries" --continue
claude -p "Generate a summary of all issues found" --continue
```

If you’re running multiple conversations, capture the session ID to resume a specific one:

```bash
session_id=$(claude -p "Start a review" --output-format json | jq -r '.session_id')
claude -p "Continue that review" --resume "$session_id"
```

source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide
title: Get started with Claude Code hooks
---

Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various points
in Claude Code’s lifecycle. Hooks provide deterministic control over Claude
Code’s behavior, ensuring certain actions always happen rather than relying on
the LLM to choose to run them.

For reference documentation on hooks, see [Hooks reference](/docs/en/hooks).

Example use cases for hooks include:

- **Notifications**: Customize how you get notified when Claude Code is awaiting
  your input or permission to run something.
- **Automatic formatting**: Run `prettier` on .ts files, `gofmt` on .go files,
  etc. after every file edit.
- **Logging**: Track and count all executed commands for compliance or
  debugging.
- **Feedback**: Provide automated feedback when Claude Code produces code that
  does not follow your codebase conventions.
- **Custom permissions**: Block modifications to production files or sensitive
  directories.

By encoding these rules as hooks rather than prompting instructions, you turn
suggestions into app-level code that executes every time it is expected to run.

You must consider the security implication of hooks as you add them, because hooks run automatically during the agent loop with your current environment’s credentials.
For example, malicious hooks code can exfiltrate your data. Always review your hooks implementation before registering them.For full security best practices, see [Security Considerations](/docs/en/hooks#security-considerations) in the hooks reference documentation.

## [​](#hook-events-overview) Hook Events Overview

Claude Code provides several hook events that run at different points in the
workflow:

- **PreToolUse**: Runs before tool calls (can block them)
- **PermissionRequest**: Runs when a permission dialog is shown (can allow or deny)
- **PostToolUse**: Runs after tool calls complete
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Runs when the user submits a prompt, before Claude processes it
- **Notification**: Runs when Claude Code sends notifications
- **Stop**: Runs when Claude Code finishes responding
- **SubagentStop**: Runs when subagent tasks complete
- **PreCompact**: Runs before Claude Code is about to run a compact operation
- **SessionStart**: Runs when Claude Code starts a new session or resumes an existing session
- **SessionEnd**: Runs when Claude Code session ends

Each event receives different data and can control Claude’s behavior in
different ways.

## [​](#quickstart) Quickstart

In this quickstart, you’ll add a hook that logs the shell commands that Claude
Code runs.

### [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

Install `jq` for JSON processing in the command line.

### [​](#step-1:-open-hooks-configuration) Step 1: Open hooks configuration

Run the `/hooks` [slash command](/docs/en/slash-commands) and select
the `PreToolUse` hook event.
`PreToolUse` hooks run before tool calls and can block them while providing
Claude feedback on what to do differently.

### [​](#step-2:-add-a-matcher) Step 2: Add a matcher

Select `+ Add new matcher…` to run your hook only on Bash tool calls.
Type `Bash` for the matcher.

You can use `*` to match all tools.

### [​](#step-3:-add-the-hook) Step 3: Add the hook

Select `+ Add new hook…` and enter this command:

```bash
jq -r '"\(.tool_input.command) - \(.tool_input.description // "No description")"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
```

### [​](#step-4:-save-your-configuration) Step 4: Save your configuration

For storage location, select `User settings` since you’re logging to your home
directory. This hook will then apply to all projects, not just your current
project.
Then press `Esc` until you return to the REPL. Your hook is now registered.

### [​](#step-5:-verify-your-hook) Step 5: Verify your hook

Run `/hooks` again or check `~/.claude/settings.json` to see your configuration:

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '\"\\(.tool_input.command) - \\(.tool_input.description // \"No description\")\"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### [​](#step-6:-test-your-hook) Step 6: Test your hook

Ask Claude to run a simple command like `ls` and check your log file:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
```

You should see entries like:

```bash
ls - Lists files and directories
```

## [​](#more-examples) More Examples

For a complete example implementation, see the [bash command validator example](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/examples/hooks/bash_command_validator_example.py) in our public codebase.

### [​](#code-formatting-hook) Code Formatting Hook

Automatically format TypeScript files after editing:

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | { read file_path; if echo \"$file_path\" | grep -q '\\.ts$'; then npx prettier --write \"$file_path\"; fi; }"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### [​](#markdown-formatting-hook) Markdown Formatting Hook

Automatically fix missing language tags and formatting issues in markdown files:

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/markdown_formatter.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Create `.claude/hooks/markdown_formatter.py` with this content:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Markdown formatter for Claude Code output.
Fixes missing language tags and spacing issues while preserving code content.
"""
import json
import sys
import re
import os

def detect_language(code):
    """Best-effort language detection from code content."""
    s = code.strip()

    # JSON detection
    if re.search(r'^\s*[{\[]', s):
        try:
            json.loads(s)
            return 'json'
        except:
            pass

    # Python detection
    if re.search(r'^\s*def\s+\w+\s*\(', s, re.M) or \
       re.search(r'^\s*(import|from)\s+\w+', s, re.M):
        return 'python'

    # JavaScript detection
    if re.search(r'\b(function\s+\w+\s*\(|const\s+\w+\s*=)', s) or \
       re.search(r'=>|console\.(log|error)', s):
        return 'javascript'

    # Bash detection
    if re.search(r'^#!.*\b(bash|sh)\b', s, re.M) or \
       re.search(r'\b(if|then|fi|for|in|do|done)\b', s):
        return 'bash'

    # SQL detection
    if re.search(r'\b(SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|CREATE)\s+', s, re.I):
        return 'sql'

    return 'text'

def format_markdown(content):
    """Format markdown content with language detection."""
    # Fix unlabeled code fences
    def add_lang_to_fence(match):
        indent, info, body, closing = match.groups()
        if not info.strip():
            lang = detect_language(body)
            return f"{indent}```{lang}\n{body}{closing}\n"
        return match.group(0)

    fence_pattern = r'(?ms)^([ \t]{0,3})```([^\n]*)\n(.*?)(\n\1```)\s*$'
    content = re.sub(fence_pattern, add_lang_to_fence, content)

    # Fix excessive blank lines (only outside code fences)
    content = re.sub(r'\n{3,}', '\n\n', content)

    return content.rstrip() + '\n'

# Main execution
try:
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
    file_path = input_data.get('tool_input', {}).get('file_path', '')

    if not file_path.endswith(('.md', '.mdx')):
        sys.exit(0)  # Not a markdown file

    if os.path.exists(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content = f.read()

        formatted = format_markdown(content)

        if formatted != content:
            with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                f.write(formatted)
            print(f"✓ Fixed markdown formatting in {file_path}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error formatting markdown: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x .claude/hooks/markdown_formatter.py
```

This hook automatically:

- Detects programming languages in unlabeled code blocks
- Adds appropriate language tags for syntax highlighting
- Fixes excessive blank lines while preserving code content
- Only processes markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`)

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Awaiting your input'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

title: Hooks reference

For a quickstart guide with examples, see [Get started with Claude Code hooks](/docs/en/hooks-guide).

## [​](#configuration) Configuration

Claude Code hooks are configured in your [settings files](/docs/en/settings):

- `~/.claude/settings.json` - User settings
- `.claude/settings.json` - Project settings
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Local project settings (not committed)
- Managed policy settings

Enterprise administrators can use `allowManagedHooksOnly` to block user, project, and plugin hooks. See [Hook configuration](/docs/en/settings#hook-configuration).

### [​](#structure) Structure

Hooks are organized by matchers, where each matcher can have multiple hooks:

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "EventName": [
      {
        "matcher": "ToolPattern",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "your-command-here"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **matcher**: Pattern to match tool names, case-sensitive (only applicable for
  `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, and `PostToolUse`)
  - Simple strings match exactly: `Write` matches only the Write tool
  - Supports regex: `Edit|Write` or `Notebook.*`
  - Use `*` to match all tools. You can also use empty string (`""`) or leave
    `matcher` blank.
- **hooks**: Array of hooks to execute when the pattern matches
  - `type`: Hook execution type - `"command"` for bash commands or `"prompt"` for LLM-based evaluation
  - `command`: (For `type: "command"`) The bash command to execute (can use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable)
  - `prompt`: (For `type: "prompt"`) The prompt to send to the LLM for evaluation
  - `timeout`: (Optional) How long a hook should run, in seconds, before canceling that specific hook

For events like `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, and `SubagentStop`
that don’t use matchers, you can omit the matcher field:

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/prompt-validator.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### [​](#project-specific-hook-scripts) Project-Specific Hook Scripts

You can use the environment variable `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (only available when
Claude Code spawns the hook command) to reference scripts stored in your project,
ensuring they work regardless of Claude’s current directory:

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/check-style.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### [​](#plugin-hooks) Plugin hooks

[Plugins](/docs/en/plugins) can provide hooks that integrate seamlessly with your user and project hooks. Plugin hooks are automatically merged with your configuration when plugins are enabled.
**How plugin hooks work**:

- Plugin hooks are defined in the plugin’s `hooks/hooks.json` file or in a file given by a custom path to the `hooks` field.
- When a plugin is enabled, its hooks are merged with user and project hooks
- Multiple hooks from different sources can respond to the same event
- Plugin hooks use the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable to reference plugin files

**Example plugin hook configuration**:

```bash
{
  "description": "Automatic code formatting",
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/format.sh",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Plugin hooks use the same format as regular hooks with an optional `description` field to explain the hook’s purpose.

Plugin hooks run alongside your custom hooks. If multiple hooks match an event, they all execute in parallel.

**Environment variables for plugins**:

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`: Absolute path to the plugin directory
- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`: Project root directory (same as for project hooks)
- All standard environment variables are available

See the [plugin components reference](/docs/en/plugins-reference#hooks) for details on creating plugin hooks.

### [​](#hooks-in-skills,-agents,-and-slash-commands) Hooks in Skills, Agents, and Slash Commands

In addition to settings files and plugins, hooks can be defined directly in [Skills](/docs/en/skills), [subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents), and [slash commands](/docs/en/slash-commands) using frontmatter. These hooks are scoped to the component’s lifecycle and only run when that component is active.
**Supported events**: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and `Stop`
**Example in a Skill**:

```bash
---
name: secure-operations
description: Perform operations with security checks
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/security-check.sh"
---
```

**Example in an agent**:

```bash
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Review code changes
hooks:
  PostToolUse:
    - matcher: "Edit|Write"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/run-linter.sh"
---
```

Component-scoped hooks follow the same configuration format as settings-based hooks but are automatically cleaned up when the component finishes executing.
**Additional option for skills and slash commands:**

- `once`: Set to `true` to run the hook only once per session. After the first successful execution, the hook is removed. Note: This option is currently only supported for skills and slash commands, not for agents.

## [​](#prompt-based-hooks) Prompt-Based Hooks

In addition to bash command hooks (`type: "command"`), Claude Code supports prompt-based hooks (`type: "prompt"`) that use an LLM to evaluate whether to allow or block an action. Prompt-based hooks are currently only supported for `Stop` and `SubagentStop` hooks, where they enable intelligent, context-aware decisions.

### [​](#how-prompt-based-hooks-work) How prompt-based hooks work

Instead of executing a bash command, prompt-based hooks:

1. Send the hook input and your prompt to a fast LLM (Haiku)
2. The LLM responds with structured JSON containing a decision
3. Claude Code processes the decision automatically

### [​](#configuration-2) Configuration

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "prompt",
            "prompt": "Evaluate if Claude should stop: $ARGUMENTS. Check if all tasks are complete."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Fields:**

- `type`: Must be `"prompt"`
- `prompt`: The prompt text to send to the LLM
  - Use `$ARGUMENTS` as a placeholder for the hook input JSON
  - If `$ARGUMENTS` is not present, input JSON is appended to the prompt
- `timeout`: (Optional) Timeout in seconds (default: 30 seconds)

### [​](#response-schema) Response schema

The LLM must respond with JSON containing:

```bash
{
  "ok": true | false,
  "reason": "Explanation for the decision"
}
```

**Response fields:**

- `ok`: `true` allows the action, `false` prevents it
- `reason`: Required when `ok` is `false`. Explanation shown to Claude

### [​](#supported-hook-events) Supported hook events

Prompt-based hooks work with any hook event, but are most useful for:

- **Stop**: Intelligently decide if Claude should continue working
- **SubagentStop**: Evaluate if a subagent has completed its task
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Validate user prompts with LLM assistance
- **PreToolUse**: Make context-aware permission decisions
- **PermissionRequest**: Intelligently allow or deny permission dialogs

### [​](#example:-intelligent-stop-hook) Example: Intelligent Stop hook

```bash
{
  "hooks": {

### [​](#comparison-with-bash-command-hooks) Comparison with bash command hooks

| Feature | Bash Command Hooks | Prompt-Based Hooks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Execution** | Runs bash script | Queries LLM |
| **Decision logic** | You implement in code | LLM evaluates context |
| **Setup complexity** | Requires script file | Configure prompt |
| **Context awareness** | Limited to script logic | Natural language understanding |
| **Performance** | Fast (local execution) | Slower (API call) |
| **Use case** | Deterministic rules | Context-aware decisions |

### [​](#best-practices) Best practices

- **Be specific in prompts**: Clearly state what you want the LLM to evaluate
- **Include decision criteria**: List the factors the LLM should consider
- **Test your prompts**: Verify the LLM makes correct decisions for your use cases
- **Set appropriate timeouts**: Default is 30 seconds, adjust if needed
- **Use for complex decisions**: Bash hooks are better for simple, deterministic rules

See the [plugin components reference](/docs/en/plugins-reference#hooks) for details on creating plugin hooks.

## [​](#hook-events) Hook Events

### [​](#pretooluse) PreToolUse

Runs after Claude creates tool parameters and before processing the tool call.
**Common matchers:**

- `Task` - Subagent tasks (see [subagents documentation](/docs/en/sub-agents))
- `Bash` - Shell commands
- `Glob` - File pattern matching
- `Grep` - Content search
- `Read` - File reading
- `Edit` - File editing
- `Write` - File writing
- `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` - Web operations

Use [PreToolUse decision control](#pretooluse-decision-control) to allow, deny, or ask for permission to use the tool.

### [​](#permissionrequest) PermissionRequest

Runs when the user is shown a permission dialog.
Use [PermissionRequest decision control](#permissionrequest-decision-control) to allow or deny on behalf of the user.
Recognizes the same matcher values as PreToolUse.

### [​](#posttooluse) PostToolUse

Runs immediately after a tool completes successfully.
Recognizes the same matcher values as PreToolUse.

### [​](#notification) Notification

Runs when Claude Code sends notifications. Supports matchers to filter by notification type.
**Common matchers:**

- `permission_prompt` - Permission requests from Claude Code
- `idle_prompt` - When Claude is waiting for user input (after 60+ seconds of idle time)
- `auth_success` - Authentication success notifications
- `elicitation_dialog` - When Claude Code needs input for MCP tool elicitation

You can use matchers to run different hooks for different notification types, or omit the matcher to run hooks for all notifications.
**Example: Different notifications for different types**

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "permission_prompt",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/permission-alert.sh"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "idle_prompt",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/idle-notification.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### [​](#userpromptsubmit) UserPromptSubmit

Runs when the user submits a prompt, before Claude processes it. This allows you
to add additional context based on the prompt/conversation, validate prompts, or
block certain types of prompts.

### [​](#stop) Stop

Runs when the main Claude Code agent has finished responding. Does not run if
the stoppage occurred due to a user interrupt.

### [​](#subagentstop) SubagentStop

Runs when a Claude Code subagent (Task tool call) has finished responding.

### [​](#precompact) PreCompact

Runs before Claude Code is about to run a compact operation.
**Matchers:**

- `manual` - Invoked from `/compact`
- `auto` - Invoked from auto-compact (due to full context window)

### [​](#sessionstart) SessionStart

Runs when Claude Code starts a new session or resumes an existing session (which
currently does start a new session under the hood). Useful for loading in
development context like existing issues or recent changes to your codebase, installing dependencies, or setting up environment variables.
**Matchers:**

- `startup` - Invoked from startup
- `resume` - Invoked from `--resume`, `--continue`, or `/resume`
- `clear` - Invoked from `/clear`
- `compact` - Invoked from auto or manual compact.

#### [​](#persisting-environment-variables) Persisting environment variables

SessionStart hooks have access to the `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` environment variable, which provides a file path where you can persist environment variables for subsequent bash commands.
**Example: Setting individual environment variables**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -n "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" ]; then
  echo 'export NODE_ENV=production' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
  echo 'export API_KEY=your-api-key' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
  echo 'export PATH="$PATH:./node_modules/.bin"' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
fi

exit 0
```

**Example: Persisting all environment changes from the hook**
When your setup modifies the environment (for example, `nvm use`), capture and persist all changes by diffing the environment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

ENV_BEFORE=$(export -p | sort)

# Run your setup commands that modify the environment
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use 20

if [ -n "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" ]; then
  ENV_AFTER=$(export -p | sort)
  comm -13 <(echo "$ENV_BEFORE") <(echo "$ENV_AFTER") >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
fi

exit 0
```

Any variables written to this file will be available in all subsequent bash commands that Claude Code executes during the session.

`CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` is only available for SessionStart hooks. Other hook types do not have access to this variable.

### [​](#sessionend) SessionEnd

Runs when a Claude Code session ends. Useful for cleanup tasks, logging session
statistics, or saving session state.
The `reason` field in the hook input will be one of:

- `clear` - Session cleared with /clear command
- `logout` - User logged out
- `prompt_input_exit` - User exited while prompt input was visible
- `other` - Other exit reasons

## [​](#hook-input) Hook Input

Hooks receive JSON data via stdin containing session information and
event-specific data:

```bash
{
  // Common fields
  session_id: string
  transcript_path: string  // Path to conversation JSON
  cwd: string              // The current working directory when the hook is invoked
  permission_mode: string  // Current permission mode: "default", "plan", "acceptEdits", "dontAsk", or "bypassPermissions"

  // Event-specific fields
  hook_event_name: string
  ...
}
```

### [​](#pretooluse-input) PreToolUse Input

The exact schema for `tool_input` depends on the tool. Here are examples for commonly hooked tools.

#### [​](#bash-tool) Bash tool

### [​](#posttooluse-input) PostToolUse Input

The exact schema for `tool_input` and `tool_response` depends on the tool.

```bash
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",

    "filePath": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "success": true
  },
  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01ABC123..."
}
```

### [​](#notification-input) Notification Input

{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",

  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "UserPromptSubmit",
  "prompt": "Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number"
}
```

### [​](#stop-and-subagentstop-input) Stop and SubagentStop Input

`stop_hook_active` is true when Claude Code is already continuing as a result of
a stop hook. Check this value or process the transcript to prevent Claude Code
from running indefinitely.

```bash
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "Stop",
  "stop_hook_active": true
}
```

### [​](#precompact-input) PreCompact Input

For `manual`, `custom_instructions` comes from what the user passes into
`/compact`. For `auto`, `custom_instructions` is empty.

```bash
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "PreCompact",
  "trigger": "manual",

}
```

### [​](#sessionstart-input) SessionStart Input

```bash
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "SessionStart",

  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "SessionEnd",
  "reason": "exit"
}
```

## [​](#hook-output) Hook Output

There are two mutually exclusive ways for hooks to return output back to Claude Code. The output
communicates whether to block and any feedback that should be shown to Claude
and the user.

### [​](#simple:-exit-code) Simple: Exit Code

Hooks communicate status through exit codes, stdout, and stderr:

- **Exit code 0**: Success. `stdout` is shown to the user in verbose mode
  (ctrl+o), except for `UserPromptSubmit` and `SessionStart`, where stdout is
  added to the context. JSON output in `stdout` is parsed for structured control
  (see [Advanced: JSON Output](#advanced-json-output)).
- **Exit code 2**: Blocking error. Only `stderr` is used as the error message
  and fed back to Claude. The format is `[command]: {stderr}`. JSON in `stdout`
  is **not** processed for exit code 2. See per-hook-event behavior below.
- **Other exit codes**: Non-blocking error. `stderr` is shown to the user in verbose mode (ctrl+o) with
  format `Failed with non-blocking status code: {stderr}`. If `stderr` is empty,
  it shows `No stderr output`. Execution continues.

Reminder: Claude Code does not see stdout if the exit code is 0, except for
the `UserPromptSubmit` hook where stdout is injected as context.

#### [​](#exit-code-2-behavior) Exit Code 2 Behavior

| Hook Event | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `PreToolUse` | Blocks the tool call, shows stderr to Claude |
| `PermissionRequest` | Denies the permission, shows stderr to Claude |
| `PostToolUse` | Shows stderr to Claude (tool already ran) |
| `Notification` | N/A, shows stderr to user only |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Blocks prompt processing, erases prompt, shows stderr to user only |
| `Stop` | Blocks stoppage, shows stderr to Claude |
| `SubagentStop` | Blocks stoppage, shows stderr to Claude subagent |
| `PreCompact` | N/A, shows stderr to user only |
| `SessionStart` | N/A, shows stderr to user only |
| `SessionEnd` | N/A, shows stderr to user only |

### [​](#advanced:-json-output) Advanced: JSON Output

Hooks can return structured JSON in `stdout` for more sophisticated control.

JSON output is only processed when the hook exits with code 0. If your hook
exits with code 2 (blocking error), `stderr` text is used directly—any JSON in `stdout`
is ignored. For other non-zero exit codes, only `stderr` is shown to the user in verbose mode (ctrl+o).

#### [​](#common-json-fields) Common JSON Fields

All hook types can include these optional fields:

```bash
{
  "continue": true, // Whether Claude should continue after hook execution (default: true)
  "stopReason": "string", // Message shown when continue is false

  "suppressOutput": true, // Hide stdout from transcript mode (default: false)
  "systemMessage": "string" // Optional warning message shown to the user
}
```

If `continue` is false, Claude stops processing after the hooks run.

- For `PreToolUse`, this is different from `"permissionDecision": "deny"`, which
  only blocks a specific tool call and provides automatic feedback to Claude.
- For `PostToolUse`, this is different from `"decision": "block"`, which
  provides automated feedback to Claude.
- For `UserPromptSubmit`, this prevents the prompt from being processed.
- For `Stop` and `SubagentStop`, this takes precedence over any
  `"decision": "block"` output.
- In all cases, `"continue" = false` takes precedence over any
  `"decision": "block"` output.

`stopReason` accompanies `continue` with a reason shown to the user, not shown
to Claude.

#### [​](#pretooluse-decision-control) `PreToolUse` Decision Control

`PreToolUse` hooks can control whether a tool call proceeds.

- `"allow"` bypasses the permission system. `permissionDecisionReason` is shown
  to the user but not to Claude.
- `"deny"` prevents the tool call from executing. `permissionDecisionReason` is
  shown to Claude.
- `"ask"` asks the user to confirm the tool call in the UI.
  `permissionDecisionReason` is shown to the user but not to Claude.

Additionally, hooks can modify tool inputs before execution using `updatedInput`:

- `updatedInput` modifies the tool’s input parameters before the tool executes
- Combine with `"permissionDecision": "allow"` to modify the input and auto-approve the tool call
- Combine with `"permissionDecision": "ask"` to modify the input and show it to the user for confirmation

Hooks can also provide context to Claude using `additionalContext`:

- `"hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext"` adds a string to Claude’s context before the tool executes.

```bash
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "allow",
    "permissionDecisionReason": "My reason here",
    "updatedInput": {
      "field_to_modify": "new value"
    },
    "additionalContext": "Current environment: production. Proceed with caution."
  }
}
```

The `decision` and `reason` fields are deprecated for PreToolUse hooks.
Use `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` and
`hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecisionReason` instead. The deprecated fields
`"approve"` and `"block"` map to `"allow"` and `"deny"` respectively.

#### [​](#permissionrequest-decision-control) `PermissionRequest` Decision Control

`PermissionRequest` hooks can allow or deny permission requests shown to the user.

- For `"behavior": "allow"` you can also optionally pass in an `"updatedInput"` that modifies the tool’s input parameters before the tool executes.
- For `"behavior": "deny"` you can also optionally pass in a `"message"` string that tells the model why the permission was denied, and a boolean `"interrupt"` which will stop Claude.

```bash
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PermissionRequest",
    "decision": {
      "behavior": "allow",
      "updatedInput": {
        "command": "npm run lint"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### [​](#posttooluse-decision-control) `PostToolUse` Decision Control

`PostToolUse` hooks can provide feedback to Claude after tool execution.

- `"block"` automatically prompts Claude with `reason`.
- `undefined` does nothing. `reason` is ignored.
- `"hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext"` adds context for Claude to consider.

```bash
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Explanation for decision",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PostToolUse",
    "additionalContext": "Additional information for Claude"
  }
}
```

#### [​](#userpromptsubmit-decision-control) `UserPromptSubmit` Decision Control

`UserPromptSubmit` hooks can control whether a user prompt is processed and add context.
**Adding context (exit code 0):**
There are two ways to add context to the conversation:

1. **Plain text stdout** (simpler): Any non-JSON text written to stdout is added
   as context. This is the easiest way to inject information.
2. **JSON with `additionalContext`** (structured): Use the JSON format below for
   more control. The `additionalContext` field is added as context.

Both methods work with exit code 0. Plain stdout is shown as hook output in
the transcript; `additionalContext` is added more discretely.
**Blocking prompts:**

- `"decision": "block"` prevents the prompt from being processed. The submitted
  prompt is erased from context. `"reason"` is shown to the user but not added
  to context.
- `"decision": undefined` (or omitted) allows the prompt to proceed normally.

```bash
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Explanation for decision",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
    "additionalContext": "My additional context here"
  }
}
```

The JSON format isn’t required for simple use cases. To add context, you can print plain text to stdout with exit code 0. Use JSON when you need to
block prompts or want more structured control.

#### [​](#stop/subagentstop-decision-control) `Stop`/`SubagentStop` Decision Control

`Stop` and `SubagentStop` hooks can control whether Claude must continue.

- `"block"` prevents Claude from stopping. You must populate `reason` for Claude
  to know how to proceed.
- `undefined` allows Claude to stop. `reason` is ignored.

```bash
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Must be provided when Claude is blocked from stopping"
}
```

#### [​](#sessionstart-decision-control) `SessionStart` Decision Control

`SessionStart` hooks allow you to load in context at the start of a session.

- `"hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext"` adds the string to the context.
- Multiple hooks’ `additionalContext` values are concatenated.

```bash
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
    "additionalContext": "My additional context here"
  }
}
```

#### [​](#sessionend-decision-control) `SessionEnd` Decision Control

`SessionEnd` hooks run when a session ends. They cannot block session termination
but can perform cleanup tasks.

#### [​](#exit-code-example:-bash-command-validation) Exit Code Example: Bash Command Validation

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import re

# Define validation rules as a list of (regex pattern, message) tuples

    ),
]

def validate_command(command: str) -> list[str]:
    issues = []

    for message in issues:
        print(f"• {message}", file=sys.stderr)
    # Exit code 2 blocks tool call and shows stderr to Claude
    sys.exit(2)
```

#### [​](#json-output-example:-userpromptsubmit-to-add-context-and-validation) JSON Output Example: UserPromptSubmit to Add Context and Validation

For `UserPromptSubmit` hooks, you can inject context using either method:

- **Plain text stdout** with exit code 0: Simplest approach, prints text
- **JSON output** with exit code 0: Use `"decision": "block"` to reject prompts,
  or `additionalContext` for structured context injection

Remember: Exit code 2 only uses `stderr` for the error message. To block using
JSON (with a custom reason), use `"decision": "block"` with exit code 0.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sys
import re
import datetime

# Load input from stdin
try:
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f"Error: Invalid JSON input: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)

prompt = input_data.get("prompt", "")

# Check for sensitive patterns
sensitive_patterns = [
    (r"(?i)\b(password|secret|key|token)\s*[:=]", "Prompt contains potential secrets"),
]

for pattern, message in sensitive_patterns:

## [​](#working-with-mcp-tools) Working with MCP Tools

Claude Code hooks work seamlessly with
[Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools](/docs/en/mcp). When MCP servers
provide tools, they appear with a special naming pattern that you can match in
your hooks.

### [​](#mcp-tool-naming) MCP Tool Naming

MCP tools follow the pattern `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, for example:

- `mcp__memory__create_entities` - Memory server’s create entities tool
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file` - Filesystem server’s read file tool
- `mcp__github__search_repositories` - GitHub server’s search tool

### [​](#configuring-hooks-for-mcp-tools) Configuring Hooks for MCP Tools

You can target specific MCP tools or entire MCP servers:

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__memory__.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'Memory operation initiated' >> ~/mcp-operations.log"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__.*__write.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/user/scripts/validate-mcp-write.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## [​](#examples) Examples

For practical examples including code formatting, notifications, and file protection, see [More Examples](/docs/en/hooks-guide#more-examples) in the get started guide.

## [​](#security-considerations) Security Considerations

### [​](#disclaimer) Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: Claude Code hooks execute arbitrary shell commands on
your system automatically. By using hooks, you acknowledge that:

- You are solely responsible for the commands you configure
- Hooks can modify, delete, or access any files your user account can access
- Malicious or poorly written hooks can cause data loss or system damage
- Anthropic provides no warranty and assumes no liability for any damages
  resulting from hook usage
- You should thoroughly test hooks in a safe environment before production use

Always review and understand any hook commands before adding them to your
configuration.

### [​](#security-best-practices) Security Best Practices

Here are some key practices for writing more secure hooks:

1. **Validate and sanitize inputs** - Never trust input data blindly
2. **Always quote shell variables** - Use `"$VAR"` not `$VAR`
3. **Block path traversal** - Check for `..` in file paths
4. **Use absolute paths** - Specify full paths for scripts (use
   “$CLAUDE\_PROJECT\_DIR” for the project path)
5. **Skip sensitive files** - Avoid `.env`, `.git/`, keys, etc.

### [​](#configuration-safety) Configuration Safety

Direct edits to hooks in settings files don’t take effect immediately. Claude
Code:

1. Captures a snapshot of hooks at startup
2. Uses this snapshot throughout the session
3. Warns if hooks are modified externally
4. Requires review in `/hooks` menu for changes to apply

This prevents malicious hook modifications from affecting your current session.

## [​](#hook-execution-details) Hook Execution Details

- **Timeout**: 60-second execution limit by default, configurable per command.
  - A timeout for an individual command does not affect the other commands.
- **Parallelization**: All matching hooks run in parallel
- **Deduplication**: Multiple identical hook commands are deduplicated automatically
- **Environment**: Runs in current directory with Claude Code’s environment
  - The `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable is available and contains the
    absolute path to the project root directory (where Claude Code was started)
  - The `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` environment variable indicates whether the hook is running in a remote (web) environment (`"true"`) or local CLI environment (not set or empty). Use this to run different logic based on execution context.
- **Input**: JSON via stdin
- **Output**:
  - PreToolUse/PermissionRequest/PostToolUse/Stop/SubagentStop: Progress shown in verbose mode (ctrl+o)
  - Notification/SessionEnd: Logged to debug only (`--debug`)
  - UserPromptSubmit/SessionStart: stdout added as context for Claude

## [​](#debugging) Debugging

### [​](#basic-troubleshooting) Basic Troubleshooting

If your hooks aren’t working:

1. **Check configuration** - Run `/hooks` to see if your hook is registered
2. **Verify syntax** - Ensure your JSON settings are valid
3. **Test commands** - Run hook commands manually first
4. **Check permissions** - Make sure scripts are executable
5. **Review logs** - Use `claude --debug` to see hook execution details

Common issues:

- **Quotes not escaped** - Use `\"` inside JSON strings
- **Wrong matcher** - Check tool names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Command not found** - Use full paths for scripts

### [​](#advanced-debugging) Advanced Debugging

For complex hook issues:

1. **Inspect hook execution** - Use `claude --debug` to see detailed hook
   execution
2. **Validate JSON schemas** - Test hook input/output with external tools
3. **Check environment variables** - Verify Claude Code’s environment is correct
4. **Test edge cases** - Try hooks with unusual file paths or inputs
5. **Monitor system resources** - Check for resource exhaustion during hook
   execution
6. **Use structured logging** - Implement logging in your hook scripts

### [​](#debug-output-example) Debug Output Example

Use `claude --debug` to see hook execution details:

```bash
[DEBUG] Executing hooks for PostToolUse:Write
[DEBUG] Getting matching hook commands for PostToolUse with query: Write
[DEBUG] Found 1 hook matchers in settings
[DEBUG] Matched 1 hooks for query "Write"
[DEBUG] Found 1 hook commands to execute
[DEBUG] Executing hook command: <Your command> with timeout 60000ms
[DEBUG] Hook command completed with status 0: <Your stdout>
```

Progress messages appear in verbose mode (ctrl+o) showing:

- Which hook is running
- Command being executed
- Success/failure status
- Output or error messages

## [​](#authentication-methods) Authentication methods

Setting up Claude Code requires access to Anthropic models. For teams, you can set up Claude Code access in one of these ways:

- [Claude for Teams or Enterprise](/docs/en/setup#for-teams-and-organizations) (recommended)
- [Claude Console with team billing](/docs/en/setup#for-teams-and-organizations)
- [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/amazon-bedrock)
- [Google Vertex AI](/docs/en/google-vertex-ai)
- [Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/microsoft-foundry)

### [​](#claude-for-teams-or-enterprise-recommended) Claude for Teams or Enterprise (recommended)

[Claude for Teams](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise) and [Claude for Enterprise](https://anthropic.com/contact-sales) provide the best experience for organizations using Claude Code. Team members get access to both Claude Code and Claude on the web with centralized billing and team management.

- **Claude for Teams**: Self-service plan with collaboration features, admin tools, and billing management. Best for smaller teams.
- **Claude for Enterprise**: Adds SSO, domain capture, role-based permissions, compliance API, and managed policy settings for organization-wide Claude Code configurations. Best for larger organizations with security and compliance requirements.

**To set up Claude Code access:**

1. Subscribe to [Claude for Teams](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise) or contact sales for [Claude for Enterprise](https://anthropic.com/contact-sales)
2. Invite team members from the admin dashboard
3. Team members install Claude Code and log in with their Claude.ai accounts

### [​](#claude-console-authentication) Claude Console authentication

For organizations that prefer API-based billing, you can set up access through the Claude Console.
**To set up Claude Code access for your team via Claude Console:**

1. Use your existing Claude Console account or create a new Claude Console account
2. You can add users through either method below:
   - Bulk invite users from within the Console (Console -> Settings -> Members -> Invite)
   - [Set up SSO](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13132885-setting-up-single-sign-on-sso)
3. When inviting users, they need one of the following roles:
   - “Claude Code” role means users can only create Claude Code API keys
   - “Developer” role means users can create any kind of API key
4. Each invited user needs to complete these steps:
   - Accept the Console invite
   - [Check system requirements](/docs/en/setup#system-requirements)
   - [Install Claude Code](/docs/en/setup#installation)
   - Login with Console account credentials

### [​](#cloud-provider-authentication) Cloud provider authentication

**To set up Claude Code access for your team via Bedrock, Vertex, or Azure:**

1. Follow the [Bedrock docs](/docs/en/amazon-bedrock), [Vertex docs](/docs/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Microsoft Foundry docs](/docs/en/microsoft-foundry)
2. Distribute the environment variables and instructions for generating cloud credentials to your users. Read more about how to [manage configuration here](/docs/en/settings).
3. Users can [install Claude Code](/docs/en/setup#installation)

## [​](#access-control-and-permissions) Access control and permissions

We support fine-grained permissions so that you’re able to specify exactly what the agent is allowed to do (e.g. run tests, run linter) and what it is not allowed to do (e.g. update cloud infrastructure). These permission settings can be checked into version control and distributed to all developers in your organization, as well as customized by individual developers.

### [​](#permission-system) Permission system

Claude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety:

| Tool Type | Example | Approval Required | ”Yes, don’t ask again” Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only | File reads, Grep | No | N/A |
| Bash Commands | Shell execution | Yes | Permanently per project directory and command |
| File Modification | Edit/write files | Yes | Until session end |

### [​](#configuring-permissions) Configuring permissions

You can view & manage Claude Code’s tool permissions with `/permissions`. This UI lists all permission rules and the settings.json file they are sourced from.

- **Allow** rules let Claude Code use the specified tool without manual approval.
- **Ask** rules prompt for confirmation whenever Claude Code tries to use the specified tool.
- **Deny** rules prevent Claude Code from using the specified tool.

Rules are evaluated in order: **deny → ask → allow**. The first matching rule wins, so deny rules always take precedence.

- **Additional directories** extend Claude’s file access to directories beyond the initial working directory.
- **Default mode** controls Claude’s permission behavior when encountering new requests.

Permission rules use the format: `Tool` or `Tool(optional-specifier)`
A rule that is just the tool name matches any use of that tool. For example, adding `Bash` to the allow list allows Claude Code to use the Bash tool without requiring user approval. Note that `Bash(*)` does **not** match all Bash commands. Use `Bash` without parentheses to match all uses.

For a quick reference on permission rule syntax including wildcards, see [Permission rule syntax](/docs/en/settings#permission-rule-syntax) in the settings documentation.

#### [​](#permission-modes) Permission modes

Claude Code supports several permission modes that can be set as the `defaultMode` in [settings files](/docs/en/settings#settings-files):

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | Standard behavior - prompts for permission on first use of each tool |
| `acceptEdits` | Automatically accepts file edit permissions for the session |
| `plan` | Plan Mode - Claude can analyze but not modify files or execute commands |
| `dontAsk` | Auto-denies tools unless pre-approved via `/permissions` or [`permissions.allow`](/docs/en/settings#permission-settings) rules |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skips all permission prompts (requires safe environment - see warning below) |

#### [​](#working-directories) Working directories

By default, Claude has access to files in the directory where it was launched. You can extend this access:

- **During startup**: Use `--add-dir <path>` CLI argument
- **During session**: Use `/add-dir` slash command
- **Persistent configuration**: Add to `additionalDirectories` in [settings files](/docs/en/settings#settings-files)

Files in additional directories follow the same permission rules as the original working directory - they become readable without prompts, and file editing permissions follow the current permission mode.

#### [​](#tool-specific-permission-rules) Tool-specific permission rules

Some tools support more fine-grained permission controls:
**Bash**
Bash permission rules support both prefix matching with `:*` and wildcard matching with `*`:

- `Bash(npm run build)` Matches the exact Bash command `npm run build`
- `Bash(npm run test:*)` Matches Bash commands starting with `npm run test`
- `Bash(npm *)` Matches any command starting with `npm`  (e.g., `npm install`, `npm run build`)
- `Bash(* install)` Matches any command ending with  `install` (e.g., `npm install`, `yarn install`)
- `Bash(git * main)` Matches commands like `git checkout main`, `git merge main`

Claude Code is aware of shell operators (like `&&`) so a prefix match rule like `Bash(safe-cmd:*)` won’t give it permission to run the command `safe-cmd && other-cmd`

Important limitations of Bash permission patterns:

1. The `:*` wildcard only works at the end of a pattern for prefix matching
2. The `*` wildcard can appear at any position and matches any sequence of characters
3. Patterns like `Bash(curl http://github.com/:*)` can be bypassed in many ways:
   - Options before URL: `curl -X GET http://github.com/...` won’t match
   - Different protocol: `curl https://github.com/...` won’t match
   - Redirects: `curl -L http://bit.ly/xyz` (redirects to github)
   - Variables: `URL=http://github.com && curl $URL` won’t match
   - Extra spaces: `curl http://github.com` won’t match

For more reliable URL filtering, consider:

- **Restrict Bash network tools**: Use deny rules to block `curl`, `wget`, and similar commands, then use the WebFetch tool with `WebFetch(domain:github.com)` permission for allowed domains
- **Use PreToolUse hooks**: Implement a hook that validates URLs in Bash commands and blocks disallowed domains
- Instructing Claude Code about your allowed curl patterns via CLAUDE.md

Note that using WebFetch alone does not prevent network access. If Bash is allowed, Claude can still use `curl`, `wget`, or other tools to reach any URL.

**Read & Edit**
`Edit` rules apply to all built-in tools that edit files. Claude will make a best-effort attempt to apply `Read` rules to all built-in tools that read files like Grep and Glob.
Read & Edit rules both follow the [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) specification with four distinct pattern types:

| Pattern | Meaning | Example | Matches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `//path` | **Absolute** path from filesystem root | `Read(//Users/alice/secrets/**)` | `/Users/alice/secrets/**` |
| `~/path` | Path from **home** directory | `Read(~/Documents/*.pdf)` | `/Users/alice/Documents/*.pdf` |
| `/path` | Path **relative to settings file** | `Edit(/src/**/*.ts)` | `<settings file path>/src/**/*.ts` |
| `path` or `./path` | Path **relative to current directory** | `Read(*.env)` | `<cwd>/*.env` |

A pattern like `/Users/alice/file` is NOT an absolute path - it’s relative to your settings file! Use `//Users/alice/file` for absolute paths.

- `Edit(/docs/**)` - Edits in `<project>/docs/` (NOT `/docs/`!)
- `Read(~/.zshrc)` - Reads your home directory’s `.zshrc`
- `Edit(//tmp/scratch.txt)` - Edits the absolute path `/tmp/scratch.txt`
- `Read(src/**)` - Reads from `<current-directory>/src/`

**WebFetch**

- `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` Matches fetch requests to example.com

**MCP**

- `mcp__puppeteer` Matches any tool provided by the `puppeteer` server (name configured in Claude Code)
- `mcp__puppeteer__*` Wildcard syntax that also matches all tools from the `puppeteer` server
- `mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate` Matches the `puppeteer_navigate` tool provided by the `puppeteer` server

**Task (Subagents)**
Use `Task(AgentName)` rules to control which [subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents) Claude can use:

- `Task(Explore)` Matches the Explore subagent
- `Task(Plan)` Matches the Plan subagent
- `Task(Verify)` Matches the Verify subagent

Add these rules to the `deny` array in your [settings](/docs/en/settings#permission-settings) or use the `--disallowedTools` CLI flag to disable specific agents. For example, to disable the Explore agent:

```bash
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["Task(Explore)"]
  }
}
```

### [​](#additional-permission-control-with-hooks) Additional permission control with hooks

[Claude Code hooks](/docs/en/hooks-guide) provide a way to register custom shell commands to perform permission evaluation at runtime. When Claude Code makes a tool call, PreToolUse hooks run before the permission system runs, and the hook output can determine whether to approve or deny the tool call in place of the permission system.

### [​](#managed-settings) Managed settings

For organizations that need centralized control over Claude Code configuration, administrators can deploy `managed-settings.json` files to [system directories](/docs/en/settings#settings-files). These policy files follow the same format as regular settings files and cannot be overridden by user or project settings.

### [​](#settings-precedence) Settings precedence

When multiple settings sources exist, they are applied in the following order (highest to lowest precedence):

1. Managed settings (`managed-settings.json`)
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
4. Shared project settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
5. User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

This hierarchy ensures that organizational policies are always enforced while still allowing flexibility at the project and user levels where appropriate.

## [​](#credential-management) Credential management

Claude Code securely manages your authentication credentials:

- **Storage location**: On macOS, API keys, OAuth tokens, and other credentials are stored in the encrypted macOS Keychain.
- **Supported authentication types**: Claude.ai credentials, Claude API credentials, Azure Auth, Bedrock Auth, and Vertex Auth.
- **Custom credential scripts**: The [`apiKeyHelper`](/docs/en/settings#available-settings) setting can be configured to run a shell script that returns an API key.
- **Refresh intervals**: By default, `apiKeyHelper` is called after 5 minutes or on HTTP 401 response. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS` environment variable for custom refresh intervals.

## [​](#background-bash-commands) Background bash commands

Claude Code supports running bash commands in the background, allowing you to continue working while long-running processes execute.

### [​](#how-backgrounding-works) How backgrounding works

When Claude Code runs a command in the background, it runs the command asynchronously and immediately returns a background task ID. Claude Code can respond to new prompts while the command continues executing in the background.
To run commands in the background, you can either:

- Prompt Claude Code to run a command in the background
- Press Ctrl+B to move a regular Bash tool invocation to the background. (Tmux users must press Ctrl+B twice due to tmux’s prefix key.)

**Key features:**

- Output is buffered and Claude can retrieve it using the TaskOutput tool
- Background tasks have unique IDs for tracking and output retrieval
- Background tasks are automatically cleaned up when Claude Code exits

To disable all background task functionality, set the `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS` environment variable to `1`. See [Environment variables](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) for details.
**Common backgrounded commands:**

- Build tools (webpack, vite, make)
- Package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Test runners (jest, pytest)
- Development servers
- Long-running processes (docker, terraform)

### [​](#bash-mode-with-prefix) Bash mode with `!` prefix

Run bash commands directly without going through Claude by prefixing your input with `!`:

```bash
! npm test
! git status
! ls -la
```

Bash mode:

- Adds the command and its output to the conversation context
- Shows real-time progress and output
- Supports the same `Ctrl+B` backgrounding for long-running commands
- Does not require Claude to interpret or approve the command

This is useful for quick shell operations while maintaining conversation context.

- **Diagnostic sharing**: Diagnostic errors (lint, syntax, etc.) from the IDE are automatically shared with Claude as you work

## [​](#installation) Installation

### [​](#marketplace-installation) Marketplace Installation

Find and install the [Claude Code plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/27310-claude-code-beta-) from the JetBrains marketplace and restart your IDE.
If you haven’t installed Claude Code yet, see [our quickstart guide](/docs/en/quickstart) for installation instructions.

After installing the plugin, you may need to restart your IDE completely for it to take effect.

## [​](#usage) Usage

### [​](#from-your-ide) From Your IDE

Run `claude` from your IDE’s integrated terminal, and all integration features will be active.

### [​](#from-external-terminals) From External Terminals

Use the `/ide` command in any external terminal to connect Claude Code to your JetBrains IDE and activate all features:

```bash
claude
> /ide
```

If you want Claude to have access to the same files as your IDE, start Claude Code from the same directory as your IDE project root.

## [​](#configuration) Configuration

### [​](#claude-code-settings) Claude Code Settings

Configure IDE integration through Claude Code’s settings:

1. Run `claude`
2. Enter the `/config` command
3. Set the diff tool to `auto` for automatic IDE detection

### [​](#plugin-settings) Plugin Settings

Configure the Claude Code plugin by going to **Settings → Tools → Claude Code [Beta]**:

#### [​](#general-settings) General Settings

- **Claude command**: Specify a custom command to run Claude (for example, `claude`, `/usr/local/bin/claude`, or `npx @anthropic/claude`)
- **Suppress notification for Claude command not found**: Skip notifications about not finding the Claude command
- **Enable using Option+Enter for multi-line prompts** (macOS only): When enabled, Option+Enter inserts new lines in Claude Code prompts. Disable if experiencing issues with the Option key being captured unexpectedly (requires terminal restart)
- **Enable automatic updates**: Automatically check for and install plugin updates (applied on restart)

For WSL users: Set `wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash -lic "claude"` as your Claude command (replace `Ubuntu` with your WSL distribution name)

#### [​](#esc-key-configuration) ESC Key Configuration

If the ESC key doesn’t interrupt Claude Code operations in JetBrains terminals:

1. Go to **Settings → Tools → Terminal**
2. Either:
   - Uncheck “Move focus to the editor with Escape”, or
   - Click “Configure terminal keybindings” and delete the “Switch focus to Editor” shortcut
3. Apply the changes

This allows the ESC key to properly interrupt Claude Code operations.

## [​](#special-configurations) Special Configurations

### [​](#remote-development) Remote Development

When using JetBrains Remote Development, you must install the plugin in the remote host via **Settings → Plugin (Host)**.

The plugin must be installed on the remote host, not on your local client machine.

### [​](#wsl-configuration) WSL Configuration

WSL users may need additional configuration for IDE detection to work properly. See our [WSL troubleshooting guide](/docs/en/troubleshooting#jetbrains-ide-not-detected-on-wsl2) for detailed setup instructions.

WSL configuration may require:

- Proper terminal configuration
- Networking mode adjustments
- Firewall settings updates

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

### [​](#plugin-not-working) Plugin Not Working

- Ensure you’re running Claude Code from the project root directory
- Check that the JetBrains plugin is enabled in the IDE settings

If clicking the Claude icon shows “command not found”:

1. Verify Claude Code is installed: `npm list -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
2. Configure the Claude command path in plugin settings
3. For WSL users, use the WSL command format mentioned in the configuration section

## [​](#security-considerations) Security Considerations

When Claude Code runs in a JetBrains IDE with auto-edit permissions enabled, it may be able to modify IDE configuration files that can be automatically executed by your IDE. This may increase the risk of running Claude Code in auto-edit mode and allow bypassing Claude Code’s permission prompts for bash execution.
When running in JetBrains IDEs, consider:

- Using manual approval mode for edits
- Taking extra care to ensure Claude is only used with trusted prompts
- Being aware of which files Claude Code has access to modify

For additional help, see our [troubleshooting guide](/docs/en/troubleshooting).

source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway
title: LLM gateway configuration
---

LLM gateways provide a centralized proxy layer between Claude Code and model providers, often providing:

- **Centralized authentication** - Single point for API key management
- **Usage tracking** - Monitor usage across teams and projects
- **Cost controls** - Implement budgets and rate limits
- **Audit logging** - Track all model interactions for compliance
- **Model routing** - Switch between providers without code changes

## [​](#gateway-requirements) Gateway requirements

For an LLM gateway to work with Claude Code, it must meet the following requirements:
**API format**
The gateway must expose to clients at least one of the following API formats:

1. **Anthropic Messages**: `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/count_tokens`
   - Must forward request headers: `anthropic-beta`, `anthropic-version`
2. **Bedrock InvokeModel**: `/invoke`, `/invoke-with-response-stream`
   - Must preserve request body fields: `anthropic_beta`, `anthropic_version`
3. **Vertex rawPredict**: `:rawPredict`, `:streamRawPredict`, `/count-tokens:rawPredict`
   - Must forward request headers: `anthropic-beta`, `anthropic-version`

Failure to forward headers or preserve body fields may result in reduced functionality or inability to use Claude Code features.

Claude Code determines which features to enable based on the API format. When using the Anthropic Messages format with Bedrock or Vertex, you may need to set environment variable `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BETAS=1`.

## [​](#configuration) Configuration

### [​](#model-selection) Model selection

By default, Claude Code will use standard model names for the selected API format.
If you have configured custom model names in your gateway, use the environment variables documented in [Model configuration](/docs/en/model-config) to match your custom names.

## [​](#litellm-configuration) LiteLLM configuration

LiteLLM is a third-party proxy service. Anthropic doesn’t endorse, maintain, or audit LiteLLM’s security or functionality. This guide is provided for informational purposes and may become outdated. Use at your own discretion.

### [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

- Claude Code updated to the latest version
- LiteLLM Proxy Server deployed and accessible
- Access to Claude models through your chosen provider

### [​](#basic-litellm-setup) Basic LiteLLM setup

**Configure Claude Code**:

#### [​](#authentication-methods) Authentication methods

##### Static API key

Simplest method using a fixed API key:

```bash
# Set in environment
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-litellm-static-key

# Or in Claude Code settings
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "sk-litellm-static-key"
  }
}
```

This value will be sent as the `Authorization` header.

##### Dynamic API key with helper

For rotating keys or per-user authentication:

1. Create an API key helper script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/bin/get-litellm-key.sh

# Example: Fetch key from vault
vault kv get -field=api_key secret/litellm/claude-code

# Example: Generate JWT token
jwt encode \
  --secret="${JWT_SECRET}" \
  --exp="+1h" \
  '{"user":"'${USER}'","team":"engineering"}'
```

2. Configure Claude Code settings to use the helper:

```bash
{
  "apiKeyHelper": "~/bin/get-litellm-key.sh"
}
```

3. Set token refresh interval:

```bash
# Refresh every hour (3600000 ms)
export CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS=3600000
```

This value will be sent as `Authorization` and `X-Api-Key` headers. The `apiKeyHelper` has lower precedence than `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

#### [​](#unified-endpoint-recommended) Unified endpoint (recommended)

Using LiteLLM’s [Anthropic format endpoint](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/anthropic_unified):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000
```

**Benefits of the unified endpoint over pass-through endpoints:**

- Load balancing
- Fallbacks
- Consistent support for cost tracking and end-user tracking

#### [​](#provider-specific-pass-through-endpoints-alternative) Provider-specific pass-through endpoints (alternative)

##### Claude API through LiteLLM

Using [pass-through endpoint](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/pass_through/anthropic_completion):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000/anthropic
```

##### Amazon Bedrock through LiteLLM

Using [pass-through endpoint](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/pass_through/bedrock):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000/bedrock
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH=1
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
```

##### Google Vertex AI through LiteLLM

Using [pass-through endpoint](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/pass_through/vertex_ai):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL=https://litellm-server:4000/vertex_ai/v1
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
export CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5
```

title: Connect Claude Code to tools via MCP
---

Claude Code can connect to hundreds of external tools and data sources through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), an open source standard for AI-tool integrations. MCP servers give Claude Code access to your tools, databases, and APIs.

## [​](#what-you-can-do-with-mcp) What you can do with MCP

With MCP servers connected, you can ask Claude Code to:

- **Implement features from issue trackers**: “Add the feature described in JIRA issue ENG-4521 and create a PR on GitHub.”
- **Analyze monitoring data**: “Check Sentry and Statsig to check the usage of the feature described in ENG-4521.”
- **Query databases**: “Find emails of 10 random users who used feature ENG-4521, based on our PostgreSQL database.”
- **Integrate designs**: “Update our standard email template based on the new Figma designs that were posted in Slack”
- **Automate workflows**: “Create Gmail drafts inviting these 10 users to a feedback session about the new feature.”

## [​](#popular-mcp-servers) Popular MCP servers

Here are some commonly used MCP servers you can connect to Claude Code:

Use third party MCP servers at your own risk - Anthropic has not verified
the correctness or security of all these servers.
Make sure you trust MCP servers you are installing.
Be especially careful when using MCP servers that could fetch untrusted
content, as these can expose you to prompt injection risk.

**Need a specific integration?** [Find hundreds more MCP servers on GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), or build your own using the [MCP SDK](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server).

## [​](#installing-mcp-servers) Installing MCP servers

MCP servers can be configured in three different ways depending on your needs:

### [​](#option-1:-add-a-remote-http-server) Option 1: Add a remote HTTP server

HTTP servers are the recommended option for connecting to remote MCP servers. This is the most widely supported transport for cloud-based services.

```bash
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport http <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Notion
claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp

# Example with Bearer token
claude mcp add --transport http secure-api https://api.example.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

### [​](#option-2:-add-a-remote-sse-server) Option 2: Add a remote SSE server

The SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport is deprecated. Use HTTP servers instead, where available.

```bash
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport sse <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Asana
claude mcp add --transport sse asana https://mcp.asana.com/sse

# Example with authentication header
claude mcp add --transport sse private-api https://api.company.com/sse \
  --header "X-API-Key: your-key-here"
```

### [​](#option-3:-add-a-local-stdio-server) Option 3: Add a local stdio server

Stdio servers run as local processes on your machine. They’re ideal for tools that need direct system access or custom scripts.

```bash
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add [options] <name> -- <command> [args...]

# Real example: Add Airtable server
claude mcp add --transport stdio --env AIRTABLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY airtable \
  -- npx -y airtable-mcp-server
```

**Important: Option ordering**All options (`--transport`, `--env`, `--scope`, `--header`) must come **before** the server name. The `--` (double dash) then separates the server name from the command and arguments that get passed to the MCP server.For example:

- `claude mcp add --transport stdio myserver -- npx server` → runs `npx server`
- `claude mcp add --transport stdio --env KEY=value myserver -- python server.py --port 8080` → runs `python server.py --port 8080` with `KEY=value` in environment

This prevents conflicts between Claude’s flags and the server’s flags.

### [​](#managing-your-servers) Managing your servers

Once configured, you can manage your MCP servers with these commands:

```bash
# List all configured servers
claude mcp list

# Get details for a specific server
claude mcp get github

# Remove a server
claude mcp remove github

# (within Claude Code) Check server status
/mcp
```

### [​](#dynamic-tool-updates) Dynamic tool updates

Claude Code supports MCP `list_changed` notifications, allowing MCP servers to dynamically update their available tools, prompts, and resources without requiring you to disconnect and reconnect. When an MCP server sends a `list_changed` notification, Claude Code automatically refreshes the available capabilities from that server.

Tips:

- Use the `--scope` flag to specify where the configuration is stored:
  - `local` (default): Available only to you in the current project (was called `project` in older versions)
  - `project`: Shared with everyone in the project via `.mcp.json` file
  - `user`: Available to you across all projects (was called `global` in older versions)
- Set environment variables with `--env` flags (for example, `--env KEY=value`)
- Configure MCP server startup timeout using the MCP\_TIMEOUT environment variable (for example, `MCP_TIMEOUT=10000 claude` sets a 10-second timeout)
- Claude Code will display a warning when MCP tool output exceeds 10,000 tokens. To increase this limit, set the `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` environment variable (for example, `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS=50000`)
- Use `/mcp` to authenticate with remote servers that require OAuth 2.0 authentication

**Windows Users**: On native Windows (not WSL), local MCP servers that use `npx` require the `cmd /c` wrapper to ensure proper execution.

```bash
# This creates command="cmd" which Windows can execute
claude mcp add --transport stdio my-server -- cmd /c npx -y @some/package
```

Without the `cmd /c` wrapper, you’ll encounter “Connection closed” errors because Windows cannot directly execute `npx`. (See the note above for an explanation of the `--` parameter.)

### [​](#plugin-provided-mcp-servers) Plugin-provided MCP servers

[Plugins](/docs/en/plugins) can bundle MCP servers, automatically providing tools and integrations when the plugin is enabled. Plugin MCP servers work identically to user-configured servers.
**How plugin MCP servers work**:

- Plugins define MCP servers in `.mcp.json` at the plugin root or inline in `plugin.json`
- When a plugin is enabled, its MCP servers start automatically
- Plugin MCP tools appear alongside manually configured MCP tools
- Plugin servers are managed through plugin installation (not `/mcp` commands)

**Example plugin MCP configuration**:
In `.mcp.json` at plugin root:

```bash
{
  "database-tools": {
    "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/db-server",
    "args": ["--config", "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json"],
    "env": {
      "DB_URL": "${DB_URL}"
    }
  }
}
```

Or inline in `plugin.json`:

```bash
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "mcpServers": {
    "plugin-api": {
      "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/api-server",
      "args": ["--port", "8080"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Plugin MCP features**:

- **Automatic lifecycle**: Servers start when plugin enables, but you must restart Claude Code to apply MCP server changes (enabling or disabling)
- **Environment variables**: Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for plugin-relative paths
- **User environment access**: Access to same environment variables as manually configured servers
- **Multiple transport types**: Support stdio, SSE, and HTTP transports (transport support may vary by server)

**Viewing plugin MCP servers**:

```bash
# Within Claude Code, see all MCP servers including plugin ones
/mcp
```

Plugin servers appear in the list with indicators showing they come from plugins.
**Benefits of plugin MCP servers**:

- **Bundled distribution**: Tools and servers packaged together
- **Automatic setup**: No manual MCP configuration needed
- **Team consistency**: Everyone gets the same tools when plugin is installed

See the [plugin components reference](/docs/en/plugins-reference#mcp-servers) for details on bundling MCP servers with plugins.

## [​](#mcp-installation-scopes) MCP installation scopes

MCP servers can be configured at three different scope levels, each serving distinct purposes for managing server accessibility and sharing. Understanding these scopes helps you determine the best way to configure servers for your specific needs.

### [​](#local-scope) Local scope

Local-scoped servers represent the default configuration level and are stored in `~/.claude.json` under your project’s path. These servers remain private to you and are only accessible when working within the current project directory. This scope is ideal for personal development servers, experimental configurations, or servers containing sensitive credentials that shouldn’t be shared.

```bash
# Add a local-scoped server (default)
claude mcp add --transport http stripe https://mcp.stripe.com

# Explicitly specify local scope
claude mcp add --transport http stripe --scope local https://mcp.stripe.com
```

### [​](#project-scope) Project scope

Project-scoped servers enable team collaboration by storing configurations in a `.mcp.json` file at your project’s root directory. This file is designed to be checked into version control, ensuring all team members have access to the same MCP tools and services. When you add a project-scoped server, Claude Code automatically creates or updates this file with the appropriate configuration structure.

```bash
# Add a project-scoped server
claude mcp add --transport http paypal --scope project https://mcp.paypal.com/mcp
```

The resulting `.mcp.json` file follows a standardized format:

```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shared-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

For security reasons, Claude Code prompts for approval before using project-scoped servers from `.mcp.json` files. If you need to reset these approval choices, use the `claude mcp reset-project-choices` command.

### [​](#user-scope) User scope

User-scoped servers are stored in `~/.claude.json` and provide cross-project accessibility, making them available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account. This scope works well for personal utility servers, development tools, or services you frequently use across different projects.

```bash
# Add a user server
claude mcp add --transport http hubspot --scope user https://mcp.hubspot.com/anthropic
```

### [​](#choosing-the-right-scope) Choosing the right scope

Select your scope based on:

- **Local scope**: Personal servers, experimental configurations, or sensitive credentials specific to one project
- **Project scope**: Team-shared servers, project-specific tools, or services required for collaboration
- **User scope**: Personal utilities needed across multiple projects, development tools, or frequently used services

**Where are MCP servers stored?**

- **User and local scope**: `~/.claude.json` (in the `mcpServers` field or under project paths)
- **Project scope**: `.mcp.json` in your project root (checked into source control)
- **Managed**: `managed-mcp.json` in system directories (see [Managed MCP configuration](#managed-mcp-configuration))

### [​](#scope-hierarchy-and-precedence) Scope hierarchy and precedence

MCP server configurations follow a clear precedence hierarchy. When servers with the same name exist at multiple scopes, the system resolves conflicts by prioritizing local-scoped servers first, followed by project-scoped servers, and finally user-scoped servers. This design ensures that personal configurations can override shared ones when needed.

### [​](#environment-variable-expansion-in-mcp-json) Environment variable expansion in `.mcp.json`

Claude Code supports environment variable expansion in `.mcp.json` files, allowing teams to share configurations while maintaining flexibility for machine-specific paths and sensitive values like API keys.
**Supported syntax:**

- `${VAR}` - Expands to the value of environment variable `VAR`
- `${VAR:-default}` - Expands to `VAR` if set, otherwise uses `default`

**Expansion locations:**
Environment variables can be expanded in:

- `command` - The server executable path
- `args` - Command-line arguments
- `env` - Environment variables passed to the server
- `url` - For HTTP server types
- `headers` - For HTTP server authentication

**Example with variable expansion:**

```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "api-server": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "${API_BASE_URL:-https://api.example.com}/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If a required environment variable is not set and has no default value, Claude Code will fail to parse the config.

## [​](#practical-examples) Practical examples

### [​](#example:-monitor-errors-with-sentry) Example: Monitor errors with Sentry

```bash
# 1. Add the Sentry MCP server
claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp

# 2. Use /mcp to authenticate with your Sentry account
> /mcp

# 3. Debug production issues
> "What are the most common errors in the last 24 hours?"
> "Show me the stack trace for error ID abc123"
> "Which deployment introduced these new errors?"
```

### [​](#example:-connect-to-github-for-code-reviews) Example: Connect to GitHub for code reviews

```bash
# 1. Add the GitHub MCP server
claude mcp add --transport http github https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/

# 2. In Claude Code, authenticate if needed
> /mcp
# Select "Authenticate" for GitHub

# 3. Now you can ask Claude to work with GitHub
> "Review PR #456 and suggest improvements"
> "Create a new issue for the bug we just found"
> "Show me all open PRs assigned to me"
```

### [​](#example:-query-your-postgresql-database) Example: Query your PostgreSQL database

```bash
# 1. Add the database server with your connection string
claude mcp add --transport stdio db -- npx -y @bytebase/dbhub \
  --dsn "postgresql://readonly:[email protected]:5432/analytics"

# 2. Query your database naturally
> "What's our total revenue this month?"
> "Show me the schema for the orders table"
> "Find customers who haven't made a purchase in 90 days"
```

## [​](#authenticate-with-remote-mcp-servers) Authenticate with remote MCP servers

Many cloud-based MCP servers require authentication. Claude Code supports OAuth 2.0 for secure connections.

1

Add the server that requires authentication

For example:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp
```

2

Use the /mcp command within Claude Code

In Claude code, use the command:

```bash
> /mcp
```

Then follow the steps in your browser to login.

Tips:

- Authentication tokens are stored securely and refreshed automatically
- Use “Clear authentication” in the `/mcp` menu to revoke access
- If your browser doesn’t open automatically, copy the provided URL
- OAuth authentication works with HTTP servers

## [​](#add-mcp-servers-from-json-configuration) Add MCP servers from JSON configuration

If you have a JSON configuration for an MCP server, you can add it directly:

1

Add an MCP server from JSON

```bash
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add-json <name> '<json>'

# Example: Adding an HTTP server with JSON configuration
claude mcp add-json weather-api '{"type":"http","url":"https://api.weather.com/mcp","headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer token"}}'

# Example: Adding a stdio server with JSON configuration
claude mcp add-json local-weather '{"type":"stdio","command":"/path/to/weather-cli","args":["--api-key","abc123"],"env":{"CACHE_DIR":"/tmp"}}'
```

2

Verify the server was added

```bash
claude mcp get weather-api
```

Tips:

- Make sure the JSON is properly escaped in your shell
- The JSON must conform to the MCP server configuration schema
- You can use `--scope user` to add the server to your user configuration instead of the project-specific one

## [​](#import-mcp-servers-from-claude-desktop) Import MCP servers from Claude Desktop

If you’ve already configured MCP servers in Claude Desktop, you can import them:

1

Import servers from Claude Desktop

```bash
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop
```

2

Select which servers to import

After running the command, you’ll see an interactive dialog that allows you to select which servers you want to import.

3

Verify the servers were imported

```bash
claude mcp list
```

Tips:

- This feature only works on macOS and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- It reads the Claude Desktop configuration file from its standard location on those platforms
- Use the `--scope user` flag to add servers to your user configuration
- Imported servers will have the same names as in Claude Desktop
- If servers with the same names already exist, they will get a numerical suffix (for example, `server_1`)

## [​](#use-claude-code-as-an-mcp-server) Use Claude Code as an MCP server

You can use Claude Code itself as an MCP server that other applications can connect to:

```bash
# Start Claude as a stdio MCP server
claude mcp serve
```

You can use this in Claude Desktop by adding this configuration to claude\_desktop\_config.json:

```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-code": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "claude",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuring the executable path**: The `command` field must reference the Claude Code executable. If the `claude` command is not in your system’s PATH, you’ll need to specify the full path to the executable.To find the full path:

```bash
which claude
```

Then use the full path in your configuration:

```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-code": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/full/path/to/claude",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Without the correct executable path, you’ll encounter errors like `spawn claude ENOENT`.

Tips:

- The server provides access to Claude’s tools like View, Edit, LS, etc.
- In Claude Desktop, try asking Claude to read files in a directory, make edits, and more.
- Note that this MCP server is only exposing Claude Code’s tools to your MCP client, so your own client is responsible for implementing user confirmation for individual tool calls.

## [​](#mcp-output-limits-and-warnings) MCP output limits and warnings

When MCP tools produce large outputs, Claude Code helps manage the token usage to prevent overwhelming your conversation context:

- **Output warning threshold**: Claude Code displays a warning when any MCP tool output exceeds 10,000 tokens
- **Configurable limit**: You can adjust the maximum allowed MCP output tokens using the `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` environment variable
- **Default limit**: The default maximum is 25,000 tokens

To increase the limit for tools that produce large outputs:

```bash
# Set a higher limit for MCP tool outputs
export MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS=50000
claude
```

This is particularly useful when working with MCP servers that:

- Query large datasets or databases
- Generate detailed reports or documentation
- Process extensive log files or debugging information

If you frequently encounter output warnings with specific MCP servers, consider increasing the limit or configuring the server to paginate or filter its responses.

## [​](#use-mcp-resources) Use MCP resources

MCP servers can expose resources that you can reference using @ mentions, similar to how you reference files.

### [​](#reference-mcp-resources) Reference MCP resources

1

List available resources

Type `@` in your prompt to see available resources from all connected MCP servers. Resources appear alongside files in the autocomplete menu.

2

Reference a specific resource

Use the format `@server:protocol://resource/path` to reference a resource:

```bash
> Can you analyze @github:issue://123 and suggest a fix?
```

```bash
> Please review the API documentation at @docs:file://api/authentication
```

3

Multiple resource references

You can reference multiple resources in a single prompt:

```bash
> Compare @postgres:schema://users with @docs:file://database/user-model
```

Tips:

- Resources are automatically fetched and included as attachments when referenced
- Resource paths are fuzzy-searchable in the @ mention autocomplete
- Claude Code automatically provides tools to list and read MCP resources when servers support them
- Resources can contain any type of content that the MCP server provides (text, JSON, structured data, etc.)

## [​](#scale-with-mcp-tool-search) Scale with MCP Tool Search

When you have many MCP servers configured, tool definitions can consume a significant portion of your context window. MCP Tool Search solves this by dynamically loading tools on-demand instead of preloading all of them.

### [​](#how-it-works) How it works

Claude Code automatically enables Tool Search when your MCP tool descriptions would consume more than 10% of the context window. You can [adjust this threshold](#configure-tool-search) or disable tool search entirely. When triggered:

1. MCP tools are deferred rather than loaded into context upfront
2. Claude uses a search tool to discover relevant MCP tools when needed
3. Only the tools Claude actually needs are loaded into context
4. MCP tools continue to work exactly as before from your perspective

### [​](#for-mcp-server-authors) For MCP server authors

If you’re building an MCP server, the server instructions field becomes more useful with Tool Search enabled. Server instructions help Claude understand when to search for your tools, similar to how [skills](/docs/en/skills) work.
Add clear, descriptive server instructions that explain:

- What category of tasks your tools handle
- When Claude should search for your tools
- Key capabilities your server provides

### [​](#configure-tool-search) Configure tool search

Tool search runs in auto mode by default, meaning it activates only when your MCP tool definitions exceed the context threshold. If you have few tools, they load normally without tool search. This feature requires models that support `tool_reference` blocks: Sonnet 4 and later, or Opus 4 and later. Haiku models do not support tool search.
Control tool search behavior with the `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` environment variable:

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` | Activates when MCP tools exceed 10% of context (default) |
| `auto:<N>` | Activates at custom threshold, where `<N>` is a percentage (e.g., `auto:5` for 5%) |
| `true` | Always enabled |
| `false` | Disabled, all MCP tools loaded upfront |

```bash
# Use a custom 5% threshold
ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=auto:5 claude

# Disable tool search entirely
ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=false claude
```

Or set the value in your [settings.json `env` field](/docs/en/settings#available-settings).
You can also disable the MCPSearch tool specifically using the `disallowedTools` setting:

```bash
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["MCPSearch"]
  }
}
```

## [​](#use-mcp-prompts-as-slash-commands) Use MCP prompts as slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts that become available as slash commands in Claude Code.

### [​](#execute-mcp-prompts) Execute MCP prompts

1

Discover available prompts

Type `/` to see all available commands, including those from MCP servers. MCP prompts appear with the format `/mcp__servername__promptname`.

2

Execute a prompt without arguments

```bash
> /mcp__github__list_prs
```

3

Execute a prompt with arguments

Many prompts accept arguments. Pass them space-separated after the command:

```bash
> /mcp__github__pr_review 456
```

```bash
> /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug in login flow" high
```

Tips:

- MCP prompts are dynamically discovered from connected servers
- Arguments are parsed based on the prompt’s defined parameters
- Prompt results are injected directly into the conversation
- Server and prompt names are normalized (spaces become underscores)

## [​](#managed-mcp-configuration) Managed MCP configuration

For organizations that need centralized control over MCP servers, Claude Code supports two configuration options:

1. **Exclusive control with `managed-mcp.json`**: Deploy a fixed set of MCP servers that users cannot modify or extend
2. **Policy-based control with allowlists/denylists**: Allow users to add their own servers, but restrict which ones are permitted

These options allow IT administrators to:

- **Control which MCP servers employees can access**: Deploy a standardized set of approved MCP servers across the organization
- **Prevent unauthorized MCP servers**: Restrict users from adding unapproved MCP servers
- **Disable MCP entirely**: Remove MCP functionality completely if needed

### [​](#option-1:-exclusive-control-with-managed-mcp-json) Option 1: Exclusive control with managed-mcp.json

When you deploy a `managed-mcp.json` file, it takes **exclusive control** over all MCP servers. Users cannot add, modify, or use any MCP servers other than those defined in this file. This is the simplest approach for organizations that want complete control.
System administrators deploy the configuration file to a system-wide directory:

- macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-mcp.json`
- Linux and WSL: `/etc/claude-code/managed-mcp.json`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-mcp.json`

These are system-wide paths (not user home directories like `~/Library/...`) that require administrator privileges. They are designed to be deployed by IT administrators.

The `managed-mcp.json` file uses the same format as a standard `.mcp.json` file:

```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    },
    "sentry": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp"
    },
    "company-internal": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/company-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--config", "/etc/company/mcp-config.json"],
      "env": {
        "COMPANY_API_URL": "https://internal.company.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### [​](#option-2:-policy-based-control-with-allowlists-and-denylists) Option 2: Policy-based control with allowlists and denylists

Instead of taking exclusive control, administrators can allow users to configure their own MCP servers while enforcing restrictions on which servers are permitted. This approach uses `allowedMcpServers` and `deniedMcpServers` in the [managed settings file](/docs/en/settings#settings-files).

**Choosing between options**: Use Option 1 (`managed-mcp.json`) when you want to deploy a fixed set of servers with no user customization. Use Option 2 (allowlists/denylists) when you want to allow users to add their own servers within policy constraints.

#### [​](#restriction-options) Restriction options

Each entry in the allowlist or denylist can restrict servers in three ways:

1. **By server name** (`serverName`): Matches the configured name of the server
2. **By command** (`serverCommand`): Matches the exact command and arguments used to start stdio servers
3. **By URL pattern** (`serverUrl`): Matches remote server URLs with wildcard support

**Important**: Each entry must have exactly one of `serverName`, `serverCommand`, or `serverUrl`.

#### [​](#example-configuration) Example configuration

```bash
{
  "allowedMcpServers": [
    // Allow by server name
    { "serverName": "github" },
    { "serverName": "sentry" },

    // Allow by exact command (for stdio servers)
    { "serverCommand": ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"] },
    { "serverCommand": ["python", "/usr/local/bin/approved-server.py"] },

    // Allow by URL pattern (for remote servers)
    { "serverUrl": "https://mcp.company.com/*" },
    { "serverUrl": "https://*.internal.corp/*" }
  ],
  "deniedMcpServers": [
    // Block by server name
    { "serverName": "dangerous-server" },

    // Block by exact command (for stdio servers)
    { "serverCommand": ["npx", "-y", "unapproved-package"] },

    // Block by URL pattern (for remote servers)
    { "serverUrl": "https://*.untrusted.com/*" }
  ]
}
```

#### [​](#how-command-based-restrictions-work) How command-based restrictions work

**Exact matching**:

- Command arrays must match **exactly** - both the command and all arguments in the correct order
- Example: `["npx", "-y", "server"]` will NOT match `["npx", "server"]` or `["npx", "-y", "server", "--flag"]`

**Stdio server behavior**:

- When the allowlist contains **any** `serverCommand` entries, stdio servers **must** match one of those commands
- Stdio servers cannot pass by name alone when command restrictions are present
- This ensures administrators can enforce which commands are allowed to run

**Non-stdio server behavior**:

- Remote servers (HTTP, SSE, WebSocket) use URL-based matching when `serverUrl` entries exist in the allowlist
- If no URL entries exist, remote servers fall back to name-based matching
- Command restrictions do not apply to remote servers

#### [​](#how-url-based-restrictions-work) How URL-based restrictions work

URL patterns support wildcards using `*` to match any sequence of characters. This is useful for allowing entire domains or subdomains.
**Wildcard examples**:

- `https://mcp.company.com/*` - Allow all paths on a specific domain
- `https://*.example.com/*` - Allow any subdomain of example.com
- `http://localhost:*/*` - Allow any port on localhost

**Remote server behavior**:

- When the allowlist contains **any** `serverUrl` entries, remote servers **must** match one of those URL patterns
- Remote servers cannot pass by name alone when URL restrictions are present
- This ensures administrators can enforce which remote endpoints are allowed

Example: URL-only allowlist

```bash
{
  "allowedMcpServers": [
    { "serverUrl": "https://mcp.company.com/*" },
    { "serverUrl": "https://*.internal.corp/*" }
  ]
}
```

**Result**:

- HTTP server at `https://mcp.company.com/api`: ✅ Allowed (matches URL pattern)
- HTTP server at `https://api.internal.corp/mcp`: ✅ Allowed (matches wildcard subdomain)
- HTTP server at `https://external.com/mcp`: ❌ Blocked (doesn’t match any URL pattern)
- Stdio server with any command: ❌ Blocked (no name or command entries to match)

Example: Command-only allowlist

```bash
{
  "allowedMcpServers": [
    { "serverCommand": ["npx", "-y", "approved-package"] }
  ]
}
```

**Result**:

- Stdio server with `["npx", "-y", "approved-package"]`: ✅ Allowed (matches command)
- Stdio server with `["node", "server.js"]`: ❌ Blocked (doesn’t match command)
- HTTP server named “my-api”: ❌ Blocked (no name entries to match)

Example: Mixed name and command allowlist

```bash
{
  "allowedMcpServers": [
    { "serverName": "github" },
    { "serverCommand": ["npx", "-y", "approved-package"] }
  ]
}
```

**Result**:

- Stdio server named “local-tool” with `["npx", "-y", "approved-package"]`: ✅ Allowed (matches command)
- Stdio server named “local-tool” with `["node", "server.js"]`: ❌ Blocked (command entries exist but doesn’t match)
- Stdio server named “github” with `["node", "server.js"]`: ❌ Blocked (stdio servers must match commands when command entries exist)
- HTTP server named “github”: ✅ Allowed (matches name)
- HTTP server named “other-api”: ❌ Blocked (name doesn’t match)

Example: Name-only allowlist

```bash
{
  "allowedMcpServers": [
    { "serverName": "github" },
    { "serverName": "internal-tool" }
  ]
}
```

**Result**:

- Stdio server named “github” with any command: ✅ Allowed (no command restrictions)
- Stdio server named “internal-tool” with any command: ✅ Allowed (no command restrictions)
- HTTP server named “github”: ✅ Allowed (matches name)
- Any server named “other”: ❌ Blocked (name doesn’t match)

#### [​](#allowlist-behavior-allowedmcpservers) Allowlist behavior (`allowedMcpServers`)

- `undefined` (default): No restrictions - users can configure any MCP server
- Empty array `[]`: Complete lockdown - users cannot configure any MCP servers
- List of entries: Users can only configure servers that match by name, command, or URL pattern

#### [​](#denylist-behavior-deniedmcpservers) Denylist behavior (`deniedMcpServers`)

- `undefined` (default): No servers are blocked
- Empty array `[]`: No servers are blocked
- List of entries: Specified servers are explicitly blocked across all scopes

#### [​](#important-notes) Important notes

- **Option 1 and Option 2 can be combined**: If `managed-mcp.json` exists, it has exclusive control and users cannot add servers. Allowlists/denylists still apply to the managed servers themselves.
- **Denylist takes absolute precedence**: If a server matches a denylist entry (by name, command, or URL), it will be blocked even if it’s on the allowlist
- Name-based, command-based, and URL-based restrictions work together: a server passes if it matches **either** a name entry, a command entry, or a URL pattern (unless blocked by denylist)

**When using `managed-mcp.json`**: Users cannot add MCP servers through `claude mcp add` or configuration files. The `allowedMcpServers` and `deniedMcpServers` settings still apply to filter which managed servers are actually loaded.

source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory
title: Manage Claude's memory
---

Claude Code can remember your preferences across sessions, like style guidelines and common commands in your workflow.

## [​](#determine-memory-type) Determine memory type

Claude Code offers four memory locations in a hierarchical structure, each serving a different purpose:

| Memory Type | Location | Purpose | Use Case Examples | Shared With |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Enterprise policy** | • macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md` • Linux: `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` • Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\CLAUDE.md` | Organization-wide instructions managed by IT/DevOps | Company coding standards, security policies, compliance requirements | All users in organization |
| **Project memory** | `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Team-shared instructions for the project | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows | Team members via source control |
| **Project rules** | `./.claude/rules/*.md` | Modular, topic-specific project instructions | Language-specific guidelines, testing conventions, API standards | Team members via source control |
| **User memory** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Personal preferences for all projects | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts | Just you (all projects) |
| **Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md` | Personal project-specific preferences | Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data | Just you (current project) |

All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code’s context when launched. Files higher in the hierarchy take precedence and are loaded first, providing a foundation that more specific memories build upon.

CLAUDE.local.md files are automatically added to .gitignore, making them ideal for private project-specific preferences that shouldn’t be checked into version control.

## [​](#claude-md-imports) CLAUDE.md imports

CLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:

```bash
See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.

# Additional Instructions
- git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md
```

Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. In particular, importing files in user’s home dir is a convenient way for your team members to provide individual instructions that are not checked into the repository. Imports are an alternative to CLAUDE.local.md that work better across multiple git worktrees.

```bash
# Individual Preferences
- @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```

To avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.

```bash
This code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
```

Imported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.

## [​](#how-claude-looks-up-memories) How Claude looks up memories

Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to (but not including) the root directory */* and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in *foo/bar/*, and have memories in both *foo/CLAUDE.md* and *foo/bar/CLAUDE.md*.
Claude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.

## [​](#directly-edit-memories-with-/memory) Directly edit memories with `/memory`

Use the `/memory` slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.

## [​](#set-up-project-memory) Set up project memory

Suppose you want to set up a CLAUDE.md file to store important project information, conventions, and frequently used commands. Project memory can be stored in either `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
Bootstrap a CLAUDE.md for your codebase with the following command:

```bash
> /init
```

Tips:

- Include frequently used commands (build, test, lint) to avoid repeated searches
- Document code style preferences and naming conventions
- Add important architectural patterns specific to your project
- CLAUDE.md memories can be used for both instructions shared with your team and for your individual preferences.

## [​](#modular-rules-with-claude/rules/) Modular rules with `.claude/rules/`

For larger projects, you can organize instructions into multiple files using the `.claude/rules/` directory. This allows teams to maintain focused, well-organized rule files instead of one large CLAUDE.md.

### [​](#basic-structure) Basic structure

Place markdown files in your project’s `.claude/rules/` directory:

```bash
your-project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md           # Main project instructions
│   └── rules/
│       ├── code-style.md   # Code style guidelines
│       ├── testing.md      # Testing conventions
│       └── security.md     # Security requirements
```

All `.md` files in `.claude/rules/` are automatically loaded as project memory, with the same priority as `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

### [​](#path-specific-rules) Path-specific rules

Rules can be scoped to specific files using YAML frontmatter with the `paths` field. These conditional rules only apply when Claude is working with files matching the specified patterns.

```bash
---
paths:
  - "src/api/**/*.ts"
---

# API Development Rules

- All API endpoints must include input validation
- Use the standard error response format
- Include OpenAPI documentation comments
```

Rules without a `paths` field are loaded unconditionally and apply to all files.

### [​](#glob-patterns) Glob patterns

The `paths` field supports standard glob patterns:

| Pattern | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `**/*.ts` | All TypeScript files in any directory |
| `src/**/*` | All files under `src/` directory |
| `*.md` | Markdown files in the project root |
| `src/components/*.tsx` | React components in a specific directory |

You can specify multiple patterns:

```bash
---
paths:
  - "src/**/*.ts"
  - "lib/**/*.ts"
  - "tests/**/*.test.ts"
---
```

Brace expansion is supported for matching multiple extensions or directories:

```bash
---
paths:
  - "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
  - "{src,lib}/**/*.ts"
---

# TypeScript/React Rules
```

This expands `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` to match both `.ts` and `.tsx` files.

### [​](#subdirectories) Subdirectories

Rules can be organized into subdirectories for better structure:

```bash
.claude/rules/
├── frontend/
│   ├── react.md
│   └── styles.md
├── backend/
│   ├── api.md
│   └── database.md
└── general.md
```

All `.md` files are discovered recursively.

### [​](#symlinks) Symlinks

The `.claude/rules/` directory supports symlinks, allowing you to share common rules across multiple projects:

```bash
# Symlink a shared rules directory
ln -s ~/shared-claude-rules .claude/rules/shared

# Symlink individual rule files
ln -s ~/company-standards/security.md .claude/rules/security.md
```

Symlinks are resolved and their contents are loaded normally. Circular symlinks are detected and handled gracefully.

### [​](#user-level-rules) User-level rules

You can create personal rules that apply to all your projects in `~/.claude/rules/`:

```bash
~/.claude/rules/
├── preferences.md    # Your personal coding preferences
└── workflows.md      # Your preferred workflows
```

User-level rules are loaded before project rules, giving project rules higher priority.

Best practices for `.claude/rules/`:

- **Keep rules focused**: Each file should cover one topic (e.g., `testing.md`, `api-design.md`)
- **Use descriptive filenames**: The filename should indicate what the rules cover
- **Use conditional rules sparingly**: Only add `paths` frontmatter when rules truly apply to specific file types
- **Organize with subdirectories**: Group related rules (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/`)

## [​](#organization-level-memory-management) Organization-level memory management

Organizations can deploy centrally managed CLAUDE.md files that apply to all users.
To set up organization-level memory management:

1. Create the managed memory file at the **Managed policy** location shown in the [memory types table above](#determine-memory-type).
2. Deploy via your configuration management system (MDM, Group Policy, Ansible, etc.) to ensure consistent distribution across all developer machines.

## [​](#memory-best-practices) Memory best practices

- **Be specific**: “Use 2-space indentation” is better than “Format code properly”.
- **Use structure to organize**: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
- **Review periodically**: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.

title: Claude Code on Microsoft Foundry
---

## [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

Before configuring Claude Code with Microsoft Foundry, ensure you have:

- An Azure subscription with access to Microsoft Foundry
- RBAC permissions to create Microsoft Foundry resources and deployments
- Azure CLI installed and configured (optional - only needed if you don’t have another mechanism for getting credentials)

## [​](#setup) Setup

### [​](#1-provision-microsoft-foundry-resource) 1. Provision Microsoft Foundry resource

First, create a Claude resource in Azure:

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/)
2. Create a new resource, noting your resource name
3. Create deployments for the Claude models:
   - Claude Opus
   - Claude Sonnet
   - Claude Haiku

### [​](#2-configure-azure-credentials) 2. Configure Azure credentials

Claude Code supports two authentication methods for Microsoft Foundry. Choose the method that best fits your security requirements.
**Option A: API key authentication**

1. Navigate to your resource in the Microsoft Foundry portal
2. Go to the **Endpoints and keys** section
3. Copy **API Key**
4. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_API_KEY=your-azure-api-key
```

**Option B: Microsoft Entra ID authentication**
When `ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_API_KEY` is not set, Claude Code automatically uses the Azure SDK [default credential chain](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/sdk/authentication/credential-chains#defaultazurecredential-overview).
This supports a variety of methods for authenticating local and remote workloads.
On local environments, you commonly may use the Azure CLI:

```bash
az login
```

When using Microsoft Foundry, the `/login` and `/logout` commands are disabled since authentication is handled through Azure credentials.

### [​](#3-configure-claude-code) 3. Configure Claude Code

Set the following environment variables to enable Microsoft Foundry. Note that your deployments’ names are set as the model identifiers in Claude Code (may be optional if using suggested deployment names).

```bash
# Enable Microsoft Foundry integration
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1

# Azure resource name (replace {resource} with your resource name)
export ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_RESOURCE={resource}

## [​](#available-models) Available models

For the `model` setting in Claude Code, you can configure either:

- A **model alias**
- A **model name**
  - Anthropic API: A full **[model name](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview#model-names)**
  - Bedrock: an inference profile ARN
  - Foundry: a deployment name
  - Vertex: a version name

### [​](#model-aliases) Model aliases

Model aliases provide a convenient way to select model settings without
remembering exact version numbers:

| Model alias | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`default`** | Recommended model setting, depending on your account type |
| **`sonnet`** | Uses the latest Sonnet model (currently Sonnet 4.5) for daily coding tasks |
| **`opus`** | Uses Opus model (currently Opus 4.5) for specialized complex reasoning tasks |
| **`haiku`** | Uses the fast and efficient Haiku model for simple tasks |
| **`sonnet[1m]`** | Uses Sonnet with a [1 million token context window](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) window for long sessions |
| **`opusplan`** | Special mode that uses `opus` during plan mode, then switches to `sonnet` for execution |

### [​](#setting-your-model) Setting your model

You can configure your model in several ways, listed in order of priority:

1. **During session** - Use `/model <alias|name>` to switch models mid-session
2. **At startup** - Launch with `claude --model <alias|name>`
3. **Environment variable** - Set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=<alias|name>`
4. **Settings** - Configure permanently in your settings file using the `model`
   field.

Example usage:

```bash
# Start with Opus
claude --model opus

# Switch to Sonnet during session
/model sonnet
```

Example settings file:

```bash
{
    "permissions": {
        ...
    },
    "model": "opus"
}
```

## [​](#special-model-behavior) Special model behavior

### [​](#default-model-setting) `default` model setting

The behavior of `default` depends on your account type.
For certain Max users, Claude Code will automatically fall back to Sonnet if you
hit a usage threshold with Opus.

### [​](#opusplan-model-setting) `opusplan` model setting

The `opusplan` model alias provides an automated hybrid approach:

- **In plan mode** - Uses `opus` for complex reasoning and architecture
  decisions
- **In execution mode** - Automatically switches to `sonnet` for code generation
  and implementation

This gives you the best of both worlds: Opus’s superior reasoning for planning,
and Sonnet’s efficiency for execution.

### [​](#extended-context-with-[1m]) Extended context with [1m]

For Console/API users, the `[1m]` suffix can be added to full model names to
enable a
[1 million token context window](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window).

```bash
# Example of using a full model name with the [1m] suffix
/model anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0[1m]
```

Note: Extended context models have
[different pricing](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing).

## [​](#checking-your-current-model) Checking your current model

You can see which model you’re currently using in several ways:

1. In [status line](/docs/en/statusline) (if configured)
2. In `/status`, which also displays your account information.

## [​](#environment-variables) Environment variables

You can use the following environment variables, which must be full **model
names** (or equivalent for your API provider), to control the model names that the aliases map to.

| Environment variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` | The model to use for `opus`, or for `opusplan` when Plan Mode is active. |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | The model to use for `sonnet`, or for `opusplan` when Plan Mode is not active. |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | The model to use for `haiku`, or [background functionality](/docs/en/costs#background-token-usage) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` | The model to use for [subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents) |

Note: `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` is deprecated in favor of
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`.

### [​](#prompt-caching-configuration) Prompt caching configuration

Claude Code automatically uses [prompt caching](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) to optimize performance and reduce costs. You can disable prompt caching globally or for specific model tiers:

| Environment variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for all models (takes precedence over per-model settings) |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_HAIKU` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Haiku models only |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_SONNET` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Sonnet models only |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_OPUS` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Opus models only |

These environment variables give you fine-grained control over prompt caching behavior. The global `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING` setting takes precedence over the model-specific settings, allowing you to quickly disable all caching when needed. The per-model settings are useful for selective control, such as when debugging specific models or working with cloud providers that may have different caching implementations.

source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/monitoring-usage
title: Monitoring
---

Claude Code supports OpenTelemetry (OTel) metrics and events for monitoring and observability.
All metrics are time series data exported via OpenTelemetry’s standard metrics protocol, and events are exported via OpenTelemetry’s logs/events protocol. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure their metrics and logs backends are properly configured and that the aggregation granularity meets their monitoring requirements.

## [​](#quick-start) Quick start

Configure OpenTelemetry using environment variables:

```bash
# 1. Enable telemetry
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1

# 2. Choose exporters (both are optional - configure only what you need)
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=otlp       # Options: otlp, prometheus, console
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp          # Options: otlp, console

# 3. Configure OTLP endpoint (for OTLP exporter)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317

# 4. Set authentication (if required)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer your-token"

# 5. For debugging: reduce export intervals
export OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL=10000  # 10 seconds (default: 60000ms)
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORT_INTERVAL=5000     # 5 seconds (default: 5000ms)

# 6. Run Claude Code
claude
```

The default export intervals are 60 seconds for metrics and 5 seconds for logs. During setup, you may want to use shorter intervals for debugging purposes. Remember to reset these for production use.

For full configuration options, see the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md#configuration-options).

## [​](#administrator-configuration) Administrator configuration

Administrators can configure OpenTelemetry settings for all users through the [managed settings file](/docs/en/settings#settings-files). This allows for centralized control of telemetry settings across an organization. See the [settings precedence](/docs/en/settings#settings-precedence) for more information about how settings are applied.
Example managed settings configuration:

```bash
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL": "grpc",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT": "http://collector.company.com:4317",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS": "Authorization=Bearer company-token"
  }
}
```

Managed settings can be distributed via MDM (Mobile Device Management) or other device management solutions. Environment variables defined in the managed settings file have high precedence and cannot be overridden by users.

## [​](#configuration-details) Configuration details

### [​](#common-configuration-variables) Common configuration variables

| Environment Variable | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY` | Enables telemetry collection (required) | `1` |
| `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` | Metrics exporter type(s) (comma-separated) | `console`, `otlp`, `prometheus` |
| `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` | Logs/events exporter type(s) (comma-separated) | `console`, `otlp` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` | Protocol for OTLP exporter (all signals) | `grpc`, `http/json`, `http/protobuf` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | OTLP collector endpoint (all signals) | `http://localhost:4317` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_PROTOCOL` | Protocol for metrics (overrides general) | `grpc`, `http/json`, `http/protobuf` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` | OTLP metrics endpoint (overrides general) | `http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_PROTOCOL` | Protocol for logs (overrides general) | `grpc`, `http/json`, `http/protobuf` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` | OTLP logs endpoint (overrides general) | `http://localhost:4318/v1/logs` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | Authentication headers for OTLP | `Authorization=Bearer token` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_CLIENT_KEY` | Client key for mTLS authentication | Path to client key file |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` | Client certificate for mTLS authentication | Path to client cert file |
| `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` | Export interval in milliseconds (default: 60000) | `5000`, `60000` |
| `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORT_INTERVAL` | Logs export interval in milliseconds (default: 5000) | `1000`, `10000` |
| `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS` | Enable logging of user prompt content (default: disabled) | `1` to enable |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OTEL_HEADERS_HELPER_DEBOUNCE_MS` | Interval for refreshing dynamic headers (default: 1740000ms / 29 minutes) | `900000` |

### [​](#metrics-cardinality-control) Metrics cardinality control

The following environment variables control which attributes are included in metrics to manage cardinality:

| Environment Variable | Description | Default Value | Example to Disable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_SESSION_ID` | Include session.id attribute in metrics | `true` | `false` |
| `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_VERSION` | Include app.version attribute in metrics | `false` | `true` |
| `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_ACCOUNT_UUID` | Include user.account\_uuid attribute in metrics | `true` | `false` |

These variables help control the cardinality of metrics, which affects storage requirements and query performance in your metrics backend. Lower cardinality generally means better performance and lower storage costs but less granular data for analysis.

### [​](#dynamic-headers) Dynamic headers

For enterprise environments that require dynamic authentication, you can configure a script to generate headers dynamically:

#### [​](#settings-configuration) Settings configuration

Add to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```bash
{
  "otelHeadersHelper": "/bin/generate_opentelemetry_headers.sh"
}
```

#### [​](#script-requirements) Script requirements

The script must output valid JSON with string key-value pairs representing HTTP headers:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example: Multiple headers
echo "{\"Authorization\": \"Bearer $(get-token.sh)\", \"X-API-Key\": \"$(get-api-key.sh)\"}"
```

#### [​](#refresh-behavior) Refresh behavior

The headers helper script runs at startup and periodically thereafter to support token refresh. By default, the script runs every 29 minutes. Customize the interval with the `CLAUDE_CODE_OTEL_HEADERS_HELPER_DEBOUNCE_MS` environment variable.

### [​](#multi-team-organization-support) Multi-team organization support

Organizations with multiple teams or departments can add custom attributes to distinguish between different groups using the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable:

```bash
# Add custom attributes for team identification
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="department=engineering,team.id=platform,cost_center=eng-123"
```

These custom attributes will be included in all metrics and events, allowing you to:

- Filter metrics by team or department
- Track costs per cost center
- Create team-specific dashboards
- Set up alerts for specific teams

**Important formatting requirements for OTEL\_RESOURCE\_ATTRIBUTES:**The `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable follows the [W3C Baggage specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/), which has strict formatting requirements:

- **No spaces allowed**: Values cannot contain spaces. For example, `user.organizationName=My Company` is invalid
- **Format**: Must be comma-separated key=value pairs: `key1=value1,key2=value2`
- **Allowed characters**: Only US-ASCII characters excluding control characters, whitespace, double quotes, commas, semicolons, and backslashes
- **Special characters**: Characters outside the allowed range must be percent-encoded

**Examples:**

```bash
# ❌ Invalid - contains spaces
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="org.name=John's Organization"

# ✅ Valid - use underscores or camelCase instead
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="org.name=Johns_Organization"
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="org.name=JohnsOrganization"

# ✅ Valid - percent-encode special characters if needed
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="org.name=John%27s%20Organization"
```

Note: wrapping values in quotes doesn’t escape spaces. For example, `org.name="My Company"` results in the literal value `"My Company"` (with quotes included), not `My Company`.

## [​](#interpreting-metrics-and-events-data) Interpreting metrics and events data

The metrics exported by Claude Code provide valuable insights into usage patterns and productivity. Here are some common visualizations and analyses you can create:

### [​](#usage-monitoring) Usage monitoring

| Metric | Analysis Opportunity |
| --- | --- |
| `claude_code.token.usage` | Break down by `type` (input/output), user, team, or model |
| `claude_code.session.count` | Track adoption and engagement over time |
| `claude_code.lines_of_code.count` | Measure productivity by tracking code additions/removals |
| `claude_code.commit.count` & `claude_code.pull_request.count` | Understand impact on development workflows |

### [​](#cost-monitoring) Cost monitoring

The `claude_code.cost.usage` metric helps with:

- Tracking usage trends across teams or individuals
- Identifying high-usage sessions for optimization

Cost metrics are approximations. For official billing data, refer to your API provider (Claude Console, AWS Bedrock, or Google Cloud Vertex).

### [​](#alerting-and-segmentation) Alerting and segmentation

Common alerts to consider:

- Cost spikes
- Unusual token consumption
- High session volume from specific users

All metrics can be segmented by `user.account_uuid`, `organization.id`, `session.id`, `model`, and `app.version`.

### [​](#event-analysis) Event analysis

The event data provides detailed insights into Claude Code interactions:
**Tool Usage Patterns**: analyze tool result events to identify:

- Most frequently used tools
- Tool success rates
- Average tool execution times
- Error patterns by tool type

**Performance Monitoring**: track API request durations and tool execution times to identify performance bottlenecks.

## [​](#backend-considerations) Backend considerations

Your choice of metrics and logs backends determines the types of analyses you can perform:

### [​](#for-metrics) For metrics

- **Time series databases (for example, Prometheus)**: Rate calculations, aggregated metrics
- **Columnar stores (for example, ClickHouse)**: Complex queries, unique user analysis
- **Full-featured observability platforms (for example, Honeycomb, Datadog)**: Advanced querying, visualization, alerting

### [​](#for-events/logs) For events/logs

- **Log aggregation systems (for example, Elasticsearch, Loki)**: Full-text search, log analysis
- **Columnar stores (for example, ClickHouse)**: Structured event analysis
- **Full-featured observability platforms (for example, Honeycomb, Datadog)**: Correlation between metrics and events

For organizations requiring Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active User (DAU/WAU/MAU) metrics, consider backends that support efficient unique value queries.

## [​](#service-information) Service information

All metrics and events are exported with the following resource attributes:

- `service.name`: `claude-code`
- `service.version`: Current Claude Code version
- `os.type`: Operating system type (for example, `linux`, `darwin`, `windows`)
- `os.version`: Operating system version string
- `host.arch`: Host architecture (for example, `amd64`, `arm64`)
- `wsl.version`: WSL version number (only present when running on Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Meter Name: `com.anthropic.claude_code`

## [​](#roi-measurement-resources) ROI measurement resources

For a comprehensive guide on measuring return on investment for Claude Code, including telemetry setup, cost analysis, productivity metrics, and automated reporting, see the [Claude Code ROI Measurement Guide](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-monitoring-guide). This repository provides ready-to-use Docker Compose configurations, Prometheus and OpenTelemetry setups, and templates for generating productivity reports integrated with tools like Linear.

## [​](#security/privacy-considerations) Security/privacy considerations

- Telemetry is opt-in and requires explicit configuration
- Sensitive information like API keys or file contents are never included in metrics or events
- User prompt content is redacted by default - only prompt length is recorded. To enable user prompt logging, set `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1`

## [​](#monitoring-claude-code-on-amazon-bedrock) Monitoring Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock

Claude Code supports various enterprise network and security configurations through environment variables. This includes routing traffic through corporate proxy servers, trusting custom Certificate Authorities (CA), and authenticating with mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) certificates for enhanced security.

All environment variables shown on this page can also be configured in [`settings.json`](/docs/en/settings).

## [​](#proxy-configuration) Proxy configuration

### [​](#environment-variables) Environment variables

Claude Code respects standard proxy environment variables:

```bash
# HTTPS proxy (recommended)
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.example.com:8080

# HTTP proxy (if HTTPS not available)
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Bypass proxy for specific requests - space-separated format
export NO_PROXY="localhost 192.168.1.1 example.com .example.com"
# Bypass proxy for specific requests - comma-separated format
export NO_PROXY="localhost,192.168.1.1,example.com,.example.com"
# Bypass proxy for all requests
export NO_PROXY="*"
```

Claude Code does not support SOCKS proxies.

### [​](#basic-authentication) Basic authentication

If your proxy requires basic authentication, include credentials in the proxy URL:

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
```

Avoid hardcoding passwords in scripts. Use environment variables or secure credential storage instead.

For proxies requiring advanced authentication (NTLM, Kerberos, etc.), consider using an LLM Gateway service that supports your authentication method.

## [​](#custom-ca-certificates) Custom CA certificates

If your enterprise environment uses custom CAs for HTTPS connections (whether through a proxy or direct API access), configure Claude Code to trust them:

```bash
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/ca-cert.pem
```

## [​](#mtls-authentication) mTLS authentication

For enterprise environments requiring client certificate authentication:

```bash
# Client certificate for authentication
export CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_CERT=/path/to/client-cert.pem

# Client private key
export CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_KEY=/path/to/client-key.pem

# Optional: Passphrase for encrypted private key
export CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_KEY_PASSPHRASE="your-passphrase"
```

## [​](#network-access-requirements) Network access requirements

Claude Code requires access to the following URLs:

- `api.anthropic.com` - Claude API endpoints
- `claude.ai` - WebFetch safeguards
- `statsig.anthropic.com` - Telemetry and metrics
- `sentry.io` - Error reporting

Ensure these URLs are allowlisted in your proxy configuration and firewall rules. This is especially important when using Claude Code in containerized or restricted network environments.

source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles
title: Output styles
---

Output styles allow you to use Claude Code as any type of agent while keeping
its core capabilities, such as running local scripts, reading/writing files, and
tracking TODOs.

## [​](#built-in-output-styles) Built-in output styles

Claude Code’s **Default** output style is the existing system prompt, designed
to help you complete software engineering tasks efficiently.
There are two additional built-in output styles focused on teaching you the
codebase and how Claude operates:

- **Explanatory**: Provides educational “Insights” in between helping you
  complete software engineering tasks. Helps you understand implementation
  choices and codebase patterns.
- **Learning**: Collaborative, learn-by-doing mode where Claude will not only
  share “Insights” while coding, but also ask you to contribute small, strategic
  pieces of code yourself. Claude Code will add `TODO(human)` markers in your
  code for you to implement.

## [​](#how-output-styles-work) How output styles work

Output styles directly modify Claude Code’s system prompt.

- All output styles exclude instructions for efficient output (such as
  responding concisely).
- Custom output styles exclude instructions for coding (such as verifying code
  with tests), unless `keep-coding-instructions` is true.
- All output styles have their own custom instructions added to the end of the
  system prompt.
- All output styles trigger reminders for Claude to adhere to the output style
  instructions during the conversation.

## [​](#change-your-output-style) Change your output style

You can either:

- Run `/output-style` to access a menu and select your output style (this can
  also be accessed from the `/config` menu)
- Run `/output-style [style]`, such as `/output-style explanatory`, to directly
  switch to a style

These changes apply to the [local project level](/docs/en/settings) and are saved in
`.claude/settings.local.json`. You can also directly edit the `outputStyle`
field in a settings file at a different level.

## [​](#create-a-custom-output-style) Create a custom output style

Custom output styles are Markdown files with frontmatter and the text that will
be added to the system prompt:

```bash
---
name: My Custom Style
description:
  A brief description of what this style does, to be displayed to the user
---

# Custom Style Instructions

You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering
tasks. [Your custom instructions here...]

## Specific Behaviors

[Define how the assistant should behave in this style...]
```

You can save these files at the user level (`~/.claude/output-styles`) or
project level (`.claude/output-styles`).

### [​](#frontmatter) Frontmatter

Output style files support frontmatter, useful for specifying metadata about the
command:

| Frontmatter | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Name of the output style, if not the file name | Inherits from file name |
| `description` | Description of the output style. Used only in the UI of `/output-style` | None |
| `keep-coding-instructions` | Whether to keep the parts of Claude Code’s system prompt related to coding. | false |

## [​](#comparisons-to-related-features) Comparisons to related features

### [​](#output-styles-vs-claude-md-vs-—append-system-prompt) Output Styles vs. CLAUDE.md vs. —append-system-prompt

Output styles completely “turn off” the parts of Claude Code’s default system
prompt specific to software engineering. Neither CLAUDE.md nor
`--append-system-prompt` edit Claude Code’s default system prompt. CLAUDE.md
adds the contents as a user message *following* Claude Code’s default system
prompt. `--append-system-prompt` appends the content to the system prompt.

### [​](#output-styles-vs-agents) Output Styles vs. [Agents](/docs/en/sub-agents)

Output styles directly affect the main agent loop and only affect the system
prompt. Agents are invoked to handle specific tasks and can include additional
settings like the model to use, the tools they have available, and some context
about when to use the agent.

### [​](#output-styles-vs-custom-slash-commands) Output Styles vs. [Custom Slash Commands](/docs/en/slash-commands)

You can think of output styles as “stored system prompts” and custom slash
commands as “stored prompts”.

## [​](#what-claude-code-does-for-you) What Claude Code does for you

- **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
- **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
- **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your team’s codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with [MCP](/docs/en/mcp) can pull from external data sources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
- **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.

## [​](#why-developers-love-claude-code) Why developers love Claude Code

- **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
- **Takes action**: Claude Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? [MCP](/docs/en/mcp) lets Claude read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use *your* custom developer tooling.
- **Unix philosophy**: Claude Code is composable and scriptable. `tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream"` *works*. Your CI can run `claude -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review"`.
- **Enterprise-ready**: Use the Claude API, or host on AWS or GCP. Enterprise-grade [security](/docs/en/security), [privacy](/docs/en/data-usage), and [compliance](https://trust.anthropic.com/) is built-in.

source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces
title: Create and distribute a plugin marketplace
---

A plugin marketplace is a catalog that lets you distribute plugins to others. Marketplaces provide centralized discovery, version tracking, automatic updates, and support for multiple source types (git repositories, local paths, and more). This guide shows you how to create your own marketplace to share plugins with your team or community.
Looking to install plugins from an existing marketplace? See [Discover and install prebuilt plugins](/docs/en/discover-plugins).

## [​](#overview) Overview

Creating and distributing a marketplace involves:

1. **Creating plugins**: build one or more plugins with commands, agents, hooks, MCP servers, or LSP servers. This guide assumes you already have plugins to distribute; see [Create plugins](/docs/en/plugins) for details on how to create them.
2. **Creating a marketplace file**: define a `marketplace.json` that lists your plugins and where to find them (see [Create the marketplace file](#create-the-marketplace-file)).
3. **Host the marketplace**: push to GitHub, GitLab, or another git host (see [Host and distribute marketplaces](#host-and-distribute-marketplaces)).
4. **Share with users**: users add your marketplace with `/plugin marketplace add` and install individual plugins (see [Discover and install plugins](/docs/en/discover-plugins)).

Once your marketplace is live, you can update it by pushing changes to your repository. Users refresh their local copy with `/plugin marketplace update`.

## [​](#walkthrough:-create-a-local-marketplace) Walkthrough: create a local marketplace

This example creates a marketplace with one plugin: a `/review` command for code reviews. You’ll create the directory structure, add a slash command, create the plugin manifest and marketplace catalog, then install and test it.

1

Create the directory structure

```bash
mkdir -p my-marketplace/.claude-plugin
mkdir -p my-marketplace/plugins/review-plugin/.claude-plugin
mkdir -p my-marketplace/plugins/review-plugin/commands
```

2

Create the plugin command

Create a Markdown file that defines what the `/review` command does.

my-marketplace/plugins/review-plugin/commands/review.md

```bash
Review the code I've selected or the recent changes for:
- Potential bugs or edge cases
- Security concerns
- Performance issues
- Readability improvements

Be concise and actionable.
```

3

Create the plugin manifest

Create a `plugin.json` file that describes the plugin. The manifest goes in the `.claude-plugin/` directory.

my-marketplace/plugins/review-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json

```bash
{
  "name": "review-plugin",
  "description": "Adds a /review command for quick code reviews",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

4

Create the marketplace file

Create the marketplace catalog that lists your plugin.

my-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json

```bash
{
  "name": "my-plugins",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Your Name"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "review-plugin",
      "source": "./plugins/review-plugin",
      "description": "Adds a /review command for quick code reviews"
    }
  ]
}
```

5

Add and install

Add the marketplace and install the plugin.

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ./my-marketplace
/plugin install review-plugin@my-plugins
```

6

Try it out

Select some code in your editor and run your new command.

```bash
/review
```

To learn more about what plugins can do, including hooks, agents, MCP servers, and LSP servers, see [Plugins](/docs/en/plugins).

**How plugins are installed**: When users install a plugin, Claude Code copies the plugin directory to a cache location. This means plugins can’t reference files outside their directory using paths like `../shared-utils`, because those files won’t be copied.If you need to share files across plugins, use symlinks (which are followed during copying) or restructure your marketplace so the shared directory is inside the plugin source path. See [Plugin caching and file resolution](/docs/en/plugins-reference#plugin-caching-and-file-resolution) for details.

## [​](#create-the-marketplace-file) Create the marketplace file

Create `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in your repository root. This file defines your marketplace’s name, owner information, and a list of plugins with their sources.
Each plugin entry needs at minimum a `name` and `source` (where to fetch it from). See the [full schema](#marketplace-schema) below for all available fields.

```bash
{
  "name": "company-tools",
  "owner": {
    "name": "DevTools Team",
    "email": "[email protected]"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "code-formatter",
      "source": "./plugins/formatter",
      "description": "Automatic code formatting on save",
      "version": "2.1.0",
      "author": {
        "name": "DevTools Team"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "deployment-tools",
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "company/deploy-plugin"
      },
      "description": "Deployment automation tools"
    }
  ]
}
```

## [​](#marketplace-schema) Marketplace schema

### [​](#required-fields) Required fields

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Marketplace identifier (kebab-case, no spaces). This is public-facing: users see it when installing plugins (for example, `/plugin install my-tool@your-marketplace`). | `"acme-tools"` |
| `owner` | object | Marketplace maintainer information ([see fields below](#owner-fields)) |  |
| `plugins` | array | List of available plugins | See below |

**Reserved names**: The following marketplace names are reserved for official Anthropic use and cannot be used by third-party marketplaces: `claude-code-marketplace`, `claude-code-plugins`, `claude-plugins-official`, `anthropic-marketplace`, `anthropic-plugins`, `agent-skills`, `life-sciences`. Names that impersonate official marketplaces (like `official-claude-plugins` or `anthropic-tools-v2`) are also blocked.

### [​](#owner-fields) Owner fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Yes | Name of the maintainer or team |
| `email` | string | No | Contact email for the maintainer |

### [​](#optional-metadata) Optional metadata

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `metadata.description` | string | Brief marketplace description |
| `metadata.version` | string | Marketplace version |
| `metadata.pluginRoot` | string | Base directory prepended to relative plugin source paths (for example, `"./plugins"` lets you write `"source": "formatter"` instead of `"source": "./plugins/formatter"`) |

## [​](#plugin-entries) Plugin entries

Each plugin entry in the `plugins` array describes a plugin and where to find it. You can include any field from the [plugin manifest schema](/docs/en/plugins-reference#plugin-manifest-schema) (like `description`, `version`, `author`, `commands`, `hooks`, etc.), plus these marketplace-specific fields: `source`, `category`, `tags`, and `strict`.

### [​](#required-fields-2) Required fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Plugin identifier (kebab-case, no spaces). This is public-facing: users see it when installing (for example, `/plugin install my-plugin@marketplace`). |
| `source` | string|object | Where to fetch the plugin from (see [Plugin sources](#plugin-sources) below) |

### [​](#optional-plugin-fields) Optional plugin fields

**Standard metadata fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | string | Brief plugin description |
| `version` | string | Plugin version |
| `author` | object | Plugin author information (`name` required, `email` optional) |
| `homepage` | string | Plugin homepage or documentation URL |
| `repository` | string | Source code repository URL |
| `license` | string | SPDX license identifier (for example, MIT, Apache-2.0) |
| `keywords` | array | Tags for plugin discovery and categorization |
| `category` | string | Plugin category for organization |
| `tags` | array | Tags for searchability |
| `strict` | boolean | Controls whether plugins need their own `plugin.json` file. When `true` (default), the plugin source must contain a `plugin.json`, and any fields you add here in the marketplace entry get merged with it. When `false`, the plugin doesn’t need its own `plugin.json`; the marketplace entry itself defines everything about the plugin. Use `false` when you want to define simple plugins entirely in your marketplace file. |

**Component configuration fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `commands` | string|array | Custom paths to command files or directories |
| `agents` | string|array | Custom paths to agent files |
| `hooks` | string|object | Custom hooks configuration or path to hooks file |
| `mcpServers` | string|object | MCP server configurations or path to MCP config |
| `lspServers` | string|object | LSP server configurations or path to LSP config |

## [​](#plugin-sources) Plugin sources

### [​](#relative-paths) Relative paths

For plugins in the same repository:

```bash
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "source": "./plugins/my-plugin"
}
```

Relative paths only work when users add your marketplace via Git (GitHub, GitLab, or git URL). If users add your marketplace via a direct URL to the `marketplace.json` file, relative paths will not resolve correctly. For URL-based distribution, use GitHub, npm, or git URL sources instead. See [Troubleshooting](#plugins-with-relative-paths-fail-in-url-based-marketplaces) for details.

### [​](#github-repositories) GitHub repositories

```bash
{
  "name": "github-plugin",
  "source": {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "owner/plugin-repo"
  }
}
```

### [​](#git-repositories) Git repositories

```bash
{
  "name": "git-plugin",
  "source": {
    "source": "url",
    "url": "https://gitlab.com/team/plugin.git"
  }
}
```

### [​](#advanced-plugin-entries) Advanced plugin entries

This example shows a plugin entry using many of the optional fields, including custom paths for commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers:

```bash
{
  "name": "enterprise-tools",
  "source": {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "company/enterprise-plugin"
  },
  "description": "Enterprise workflow automation tools",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Enterprise Team",
    "email": "[email protected]"
  },
  "homepage": "https://docs.example.com/plugins/enterprise-tools",
  "repository": "https://github.com/company/enterprise-plugin",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["enterprise", "workflow", "automation"],
  "category": "productivity",
  "commands": [
    "./commands/core/",
    "./commands/enterprise/",
    "./commands/experimental/preview.md"
  ],
  "agents": ["./agents/security-reviewer.md", "./agents/compliance-checker.md"],
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "enterprise-db": {
      "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/db-server",
      "args": ["--config", "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json"]
    }
  },
  "strict": false
}
```

Key things to notice:

- **`commands` and `agents`**: You can specify multiple directories or individual files. Paths are relative to the plugin root.
- **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`**: Use this variable in hooks and MCP server configs to reference files within the plugin’s installation directory. This is necessary because plugins are copied to a cache location when installed.
- **`strict: false`**: Since this is set to false, the plugin doesn’t need its own `plugin.json`. The marketplace entry defines everything.

## [​](#host-and-distribute-marketplaces) Host and distribute marketplaces

### [​](#host-on-github-recommended) Host on GitHub (recommended)

GitHub provides the easiest distribution method:

1. **Create a repository**: Set up a new repository for your marketplace
2. **Add marketplace file**: Create `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with your plugin definitions
3. **Share with teams**: Users add your marketplace with `/plugin marketplace add owner/repo`

**Benefits**: Built-in version control, issue tracking, and team collaboration features.

### [​](#host-on-other-git-services) Host on other git services

Any git hosting service works, such as GitLab, Bitbucket, and self-hosted servers. Users add with the full repository URL:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git
```

### [​](#private-repositories) Private repositories

Claude Code supports installing plugins from private repositories. Set the appropriate authentication token in your environment, and Claude Code will use it when authentication is required.

| Provider | Environment variables | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` | Personal access token or GitHub App token |
| GitLab | `GITLAB_TOKEN` or `GL_TOKEN` | Personal access token or project token |
| Bitbucket | `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` | App password or repository access token |

Set the token in your shell configuration (for example, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) or pass it when running Claude Code:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Authentication tokens are only used when a repository requires authentication. Public repositories work without any tokens configured, even if tokens are present in your environment.

For CI/CD environments, configure the token as a secret environment variable. GitHub Actions automatically provides `GITHUB_TOKEN` for repositories in the same organization.

### [​](#test-locally-before-distribution) Test locally before distribution

Test your marketplace locally before sharing:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ./my-local-marketplace
/plugin install test-plugin@my-local-marketplace
```

For the full range of add commands (GitHub, Git URLs, local paths, remote URLs), see [Add marketplaces](/docs/en/discover-plugins#add-marketplaces).

### [​](#require-marketplaces-for-your-team) Require marketplaces for your team

You can configure your repository so team members are automatically prompted to install your marketplace when they trust the project folder. Add your marketplace to `.claude/settings.json`:

```bash
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "company-tools": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "your-org/claude-plugins"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also specify which plugins should be enabled by default:

```bash
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "code-formatter@company-tools": true,
    "deployment-tools@company-tools": true
  }
}
```

For full configuration options, see [Plugin settings](/docs/en/settings#plugin-settings).

### [​](#managed-marketplace-restrictions) Managed marketplace restrictions

For organizations requiring strict control over plugin sources, administrators can restrict which plugin marketplaces users are allowed to add using the [`strictKnownMarketplaces`](/docs/en/settings#strictknownmarketplaces) setting in managed settings.
When `strictKnownMarketplaces` is configured in managed settings, the restriction behavior depends on the value:

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Undefined (default) | No restrictions. Users can add any marketplace |
| Empty array `[]` | Complete lockdown. Users cannot add any new marketplaces |
| List of sources | Users can only add marketplaces that match the allowlist exactly |

#### [​](#common-configurations) Common configurations

Disable all marketplace additions:

```bash
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": []
}
```

Allow specific marketplaces only:

```bash
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins"
    },
    {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/security-tools",
      "ref": "v2.0"
    },
    {
      "source": "url",
      "url": "https://plugins.example.com/marketplace.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### [​](#how-restrictions-work) How restrictions work

Restrictions are validated early in the plugin installation process, before any network requests or filesystem operations occur. This prevents unauthorized marketplace access attempts.
The allowlist uses exact matching. For a marketplace to be allowed, all specified fields must match exactly:

- For GitHub sources: `repo` is required, and `ref` or `path` must also match if specified in the allowlist
- For URL sources: the full URL must match exactly

Because `strictKnownMarketplaces` is set in [managed settings](/docs/en/settings#settings-file-locations), individual users and project configurations cannot override these restrictions.
For complete configuration details including all supported source types and comparison with `extraKnownMarketplaces`, see the [strictKnownMarketplaces reference](/docs/en/settings#strictknownmarketplaces).

## [​](#validation-and-testing) Validation and testing

Test your marketplace before sharing.
Validate your marketplace JSON syntax:

```bash
claude plugin validate .
```

Or from within Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin validate .
```

Add the marketplace for testing:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ./path/to/marketplace
```

Install a test plugin to verify everything works:

```bash
/plugin install test-plugin@marketplace-name
```

For complete plugin testing workflows, see [Test your plugins locally](/docs/en/plugins#test-your-plugins-locally). For technical troubleshooting, see [Plugins reference](/docs/en/plugins-reference).

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

### [​](#marketplace-not-loading) Marketplace not loading

**Symptoms**: Can’t add marketplace or see plugins from it
**Solutions**:

- Verify the marketplace URL is accessible
- Check that `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` exists at the specified path
- Ensure JSON syntax is valid using `claude plugin validate` or `/plugin validate`
- For private repositories, confirm you have access permissions

### [​](#marketplace-validation-errors) Marketplace validation errors

Run `claude plugin validate .` or `/plugin validate .` from your marketplace directory to check for issues. Common errors:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `File not found: .claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Missing manifest | Create `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with required fields |
| `Invalid JSON syntax: Unexpected token...` | JSON syntax error | Check for missing commas, extra commas, or unquoted strings |
| `Duplicate plugin name "x" found in marketplace` | Two plugins share the same name | Give each plugin a unique `name` value |
| `plugins[0].source: Path traversal not allowed` | Source path contains `..` | Use paths relative to marketplace root without `..` |

**Warnings** (non-blocking):

- `Marketplace has no plugins defined`: add at least one plugin to the `plugins` array
- `No marketplace description provided`: add `metadata.description` to help users understand your marketplace
- `Plugin "x" uses npm source which is not yet fully implemented`: use `github` or local path sources instead

### [​](#plugin-installation-failures) Plugin installation failures

**Symptoms**: Marketplace appears but plugin installation fails
**Solutions**:

- Verify plugin source URLs are accessible
- Check that plugin directories contain required files
- For GitHub sources, ensure repositories are public or you have access
- Test plugin sources manually by cloning/downloading

### [​](#private-repository-authentication-fails) Private repository authentication fails

**Symptoms**: Authentication errors when installing plugins from private repositories, even with tokens configured
**Solutions**:

- Verify your token is set in the current shell session: `echo $GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Check that the token has the required permissions (read access to the repository)
- For GitHub, ensure the token has the `repo` scope for private repositories
- For GitLab, ensure the token has at least `read_repository` scope
- Verify the token hasn’t expired
- If using multiple git providers, ensure you’ve set the token for the correct provider

### [​](#plugins-with-relative-paths-fail-in-url-based-marketplaces) Plugins with relative paths fail in URL-based marketplaces

**Symptoms**: Added a marketplace via URL (such as `https://example.com/marketplace.json`), but plugins with relative path sources like `"./plugins/my-plugin"` fail to install with “path not found” errors.
**Cause**: URL-based marketplaces only download the `marketplace.json` file itself. They do not download plugin files from the server. Relative paths in the marketplace entry reference files on the remote server that were not downloaded.
**Solutions**:

- **Use external sources**: Change plugin entries to use GitHub, npm, or git URL sources instead of relative paths:

  ```bash
  { "name": "my-plugin", "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "owner/repo" } }
  ```
- **Use a Git-based marketplace**: Host your marketplace in a Git repository and add it with the git URL. Git-based marketplaces clone the entire repository, making relative paths work correctly.

### [​](#files-not-found-after-installation) Files not found after installation

**Symptoms**: Plugin installs but references to files fail, especially files outside the plugin directory
**Cause**: Plugins are copied to a cache directory rather than used in-place. Paths that reference files outside the plugin’s directory (such as `../shared-utils`) won’t work because those files aren’t copied.
**Solutions**: See [Plugin caching and file resolution](/docs/en/plugins-reference#plugin-caching-and-file-resolution) for workarounds including symlinks and directory restructuring.
For additional debugging tools and common issues, see [Debugging and development tools](/docs/en/plugins-reference#debugging-and-development-tools).

This reference provides complete technical specifications for the Claude Code plugin system, including component schemas, CLI commands, and development tools.

## [​](#plugin-components-reference) Plugin components reference

This section documents the five types of components that plugins can provide.

### [​](#commands) Commands

Plugins add custom slash commands that integrate seamlessly with Claude Code’s command system.
**Location**: `commands/` directory in plugin root
**File format**: Markdown files with frontmatter
For complete details on plugin command structure, invocation patterns, and features, see [Plugin commands](/docs/en/slash-commands#plugin-commands).

### [​](#agents) Agents

Plugins can provide specialized subagents for specific tasks that Claude can invoke automatically when appropriate.
**Location**: `agents/` directory in plugin root
**File format**: Markdown files describing agent capabilities
**Agent structure**:

```bash
---
description: What this agent specializes in
capabilities: ["task1", "task2", "task3"]
---

# Agent Name

Detailed description of the agent's role, expertise, and when Claude should invoke it.

## Capabilities
- Specific task the agent excels at
- Another specialized capability
- When to use this agent vs others

## Context and examples
Provide examples of when this agent should be used and what kinds of problems it solves.
```

**Integration points**:

- Agents appear in the `/agents` interface
- Claude can invoke agents automatically based on task context
- Agents can be invoked manually by users
- Plugin agents work alongside built-in Claude agents

### [​](#skills) Skills

Plugins can provide Agent Skills that extend Claude’s capabilities. Skills are model-invoked—Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on the task context.
**Location**: `skills/` directory in plugin root
**File format**: Directories containing `SKILL.md` files with frontmatter
**Skill structure**:

```bash
skills/
├── pdf-processor/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── reference.md (optional)
│   └── scripts/ (optional)
└── code-reviewer/
    └── SKILL.md
```

**Integration behavior**:

- Plugin Skills are automatically discovered when the plugin is installed
- Claude autonomously invokes Skills based on matching task context
- Skills can include supporting files alongside SKILL.md

For SKILL.md format and complete Skill authoring guidance, see:

- [Use Skills in Claude Code](/docs/en/skills)
- [Agent Skills overview](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure)

### [​](#hooks) Hooks

Plugins can provide event handlers that respond to Claude Code events automatically.
**Location**: `hooks/hooks.json` in plugin root, or inline in plugin.json
**Format**: JSON configuration with event matchers and actions
**Hook configuration**:

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/format-code.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Available events**:

- `PreToolUse`: Before Claude uses any tool
- `PostToolUse`: After Claude successfully uses any tool
- `PostToolUseFailure`: After Claude tool execution fails
- `PermissionRequest`: When a permission dialog is shown
- `UserPromptSubmit`: When user submits a prompt
- `Notification`: When Claude Code sends notifications
- `Stop`: When Claude attempts to stop
- `SubagentStart`: When a subagent is started
- `SubagentStop`: When a subagent attempts to stop
- `SessionStart`: At the beginning of sessions
- `SessionEnd`: At the end of sessions
- `PreCompact`: Before conversation history is compacted

**Hook types**:

- `command`: Execute shell commands or scripts
- `prompt`: Evaluate a prompt with an LLM (uses `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for context)
- `agent`: Run an agentic verifier with tools for complex verification tasks

### [​](#mcp-servers) MCP servers

Plugins can bundle Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to connect Claude Code with external tools and services.
**Location**: `.mcp.json` in plugin root, or inline in plugin.json
**Format**: Standard MCP server configuration
**MCP server configuration**:

```bash
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plugin-database": {
      "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/db-server",
      "args": ["--config", "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json"],
      "env": {
        "DB_PATH": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/data"
      }
    },
    "plugin-api-client": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@company/mcp-server", "--plugin-mode"],
      "cwd": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Integration behavior**:

- Plugin MCP servers start automatically when the plugin is enabled
- Servers appear as standard MCP tools in Claude’s toolkit
- Server capabilities integrate seamlessly with Claude’s existing tools
- Plugin servers can be configured independently of user MCP servers

### [​](#lsp-servers) LSP servers

Looking to use LSP plugins? Install them from the official marketplace—search for “lsp” in the `/plugin` Discover tab. This section documents how to create LSP plugins for languages not covered by the official marketplace.

Plugins can provide [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP) servers to give Claude real-time code intelligence while working on your codebase.
LSP integration provides:

- **Instant diagnostics**: Claude sees errors and warnings immediately after each edit
- **Code navigation**: go to definition, find references, and hover information
- **Language awareness**: type information and documentation for code symbols

**Location**: `.lsp.json` in plugin root, or inline in `plugin.json`
**Format**: JSON configuration mapping language server names to their configurations
**`.lsp.json` file format**:

```bash
{
  "go": {
    "command": "gopls",
    "args": ["serve"],
    "extensionToLanguage": {
      ".go": "go"
    }
  }
}
```

**Inline in `plugin.json`**:

```bash
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "lspServers": {
    "go": {
      "command": "gopls",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "extensionToLanguage": {
        ".go": "go"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Required fields:**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `command` | The LSP binary to execute (must be in PATH) |
| `extensionToLanguage` | Maps file extensions to language identifiers |

**Optional fields:**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `args` | Command-line arguments for the LSP server |
| `transport` | Communication transport: `stdio` (default) or `socket` |
| `env` | Environment variables to set when starting the server |
| `initializationOptions` | Options passed to the server during initialization |
| `settings` | Settings passed via `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` |
| `workspaceFolder` | Workspace folder path for the server |
| `startupTimeout` | Max time to wait for server startup (milliseconds) |
| `shutdownTimeout` | Max time to wait for graceful shutdown (milliseconds) |
| `restartOnCrash` | Whether to automatically restart the server if it crashes |
| `maxRestarts` | Maximum number of restart attempts before giving up |

**You must install the language server binary separately.** LSP plugins configure how Claude Code connects to a language server, but they don’t include the server itself. If you see `Executable not found in $PATH` in the `/plugin` Errors tab, install the required binary for your language.

**Available LSP plugins:**

| Plugin | Language server | Install command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pyright-lsp` | Pyright (Python) | `pip install pyright` or `npm install -g pyright` |
| `typescript-lsp` | TypeScript Language Server | `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript` |
| `rust-lsp` | rust-analyzer | [See rust-analyzer installation](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#installation) |

Install the language server first, then install the plugin from the marketplace.

---

## [​](#plugin-installation-scopes) Plugin installation scopes

When you install a plugin, you choose a **scope** that determines where the plugin is available and who else can use it:

| Scope | Settings file | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user` | `~/.claude/settings.json` | Personal plugins available across all projects (default) |
| `project` | `.claude/settings.json` | Team plugins shared via version control |
| `local` | `.claude/settings.local.json` | Project-specific plugins, gitignored |
| `managed` | `managed-settings.json` | Managed plugins (read-only, update only) |

Plugins use the same scope system as other Claude Code configurations. For installation instructions and scope flags, see [Install plugins](/docs/en/discover-plugins#install-plugins). For a complete explanation of scopes, see [Configuration scopes](/docs/en/settings#configuration-scopes).

---

## [​](#plugin-manifest-schema) Plugin manifest schema

The `plugin.json` file defines your plugin’s metadata and configuration. This section documents all supported fields and options.

### [​](#complete-schema) Complete schema

```bash
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "description": "Brief plugin description",

| `lspServers` | string|object | [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) config for code intelligence (go to definition, find references, etc.) | `"./.lsp.json"` |

### [​](#path-behavior-rules) Path behavior rules

**Important**: Custom paths supplement default directories - they don’t replace them.

- If `commands/` exists, it’s loaded in addition to custom command paths
- All paths must be relative to plugin root and start with `./`
- Commands from custom paths use the same naming and namespacing rules
- Multiple paths can be specified as arrays for flexibility

**Path examples**:

```bash
{
  "commands": [
    "./specialized/deploy.md",
    "./utilities/batch-process.md"
  ],
  "agents": [
    "./custom-agents/reviewer.md",
    "./custom-agents/tester.md"
  ]
}
```

### [​](#environment-variables) Environment variables

**`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`**: Contains the absolute path to your plugin directory. Use this in hooks, MCP servers, and scripts to ensure correct paths regardless of installation location.

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/process.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## [​](#plugin-caching-and-file-resolution) Plugin caching and file resolution

For security and verification purposes, Claude Code copies plugins to a cache directory rather than using them in-place. Understanding this behavior is important when developing plugins that reference external files.

### [​](#how-plugin-caching-works) How plugin caching works

When you install a plugin, Claude Code copies the plugin files to a cache directory:

- **For marketplace plugins with relative paths**: The path specified in the `source` field is copied recursively. For example, if your marketplace entry specifies `"source": "./plugins/my-plugin"`, the entire `./plugins` directory is copied.
- **For plugins with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`**: The implicit root directory (the directory containing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) is copied recursively.

### [​](#path-traversal-limitations) Path traversal limitations

Plugins cannot reference files outside their copied directory structure. Paths that traverse outside the plugin root (such as `../shared-utils`) will not work after installation because those external files are not copied to the cache.

### [​](#working-with-external-dependencies) Working with external dependencies

If your plugin needs to access files outside its directory, you have two options:
**Option 1: Use symlinks**
Create symbolic links to external files within your plugin directory. Symlinks are honored during the copy process:

```bash
# Inside your plugin directory
ln -s /path/to/shared-utils ./shared-utils
```

The symlinked content will be copied into the plugin cache.
**Option 2: Restructure your marketplace**
Set the plugin path to a parent directory that contains all required files, then provide the rest of the plugin manifest directly in the marketplace entry:

```bash
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "source": "./",
  "description": "Plugin that needs root-level access",
  "commands": ["./plugins/my-plugin/commands/"],
  "agents": ["./plugins/my-plugin/agents/"],
  "strict": false
}
```

This approach copies the entire marketplace root, giving your plugin access to sibling directories.

Symlinks that point to locations outside the plugin’s logical root are followed during copying. This provides flexibility while maintaining the security benefits of the caching system.

## [​](#plugin-directory-structure) Plugin directory structure

### [​](#standard-plugin-layout) Standard plugin layout

A complete plugin follows this structure:

```bash
enterprise-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/           # Metadata directory
│   └── plugin.json          # Required: plugin manifest
├── commands/                 # Default command location
│   ├── status.md
│   └── logs.md
├── agents/                   # Default agent location
│   ├── security-reviewer.md
│   ├── performance-tester.md
│   └── compliance-checker.md
├── skills/                   # Agent Skills

│   └── deploy.js
├── LICENSE                  # License file
└── CHANGELOG.md             # Version history
```

The `.claude-plugin/` directory contains the `plugin.json` file. All other directories (commands/, agents/, skills/, hooks/) must be at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`.

### [​](#file-locations-reference) File locations reference

| Component | Default Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Manifest** | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Required metadata file |
| **Commands** | `commands/` | Slash command Markdown files |
| **Agents** | `agents/` | Subagent Markdown files |
| **Skills** | `skills/` | Agent Skills with SKILL.md files |
| **Hooks** | `hooks/hooks.json` | Hook configuration |
| **MCP servers** | `.mcp.json` | MCP server definitions |
| **LSP servers** | `.lsp.json` | Language server configurations |

---

## [​](#debugging-and-development-tools) Debugging and development tools

### [​](#debugging-commands) Debugging commands

Use `claude --debug` to see plugin loading details:

```bash
claude --debug
```

This shows:

- Which plugins are being loaded
- Any errors in plugin manifests
- Command, agent, and hook registration
- MCP server initialization

### [​](#common-issues) Common issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plugin not loading | Invalid `plugin.json` | Validate JSON syntax with `claude plugin validate` or `/plugin validate` |
| Commands not appearing | Wrong directory structure | Ensure `commands/` at root, not in `.claude-plugin/` |
| Hooks not firing | Script not executable | Run `chmod +x script.sh` |
| MCP server fails | Missing `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | Use variable for all plugin paths |
| Path errors | Absolute paths used | All paths must be relative and start with `./` |
| LSP `Executable not found in $PATH` | Language server not installed | Install the binary (e.g., `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript`) |

### [​](#example-error-messages) Example error messages

**Manifest validation errors**:

- `Invalid JSON syntax: Unexpected token } in JSON at position 142`: check for missing commas, extra commas, or unquoted strings
- `Plugin has an invalid manifest file at .claude-plugin/plugin.json. Validation errors: name: Required`: a required field is missing
- `Plugin has a corrupt manifest file at .claude-plugin/plugin.json. JSON parse error: ...`: JSON syntax error

**Plugin loading errors**:

- `Warning: No commands found in plugin my-plugin custom directory: ./cmds. Expected .md files or SKILL.md in subdirectories.`: command path exists but contains no valid command files
- `Plugin directory not found at path: ./plugins/my-plugin. Check that the marketplace entry has the correct path.`: the `source` path in marketplace.json points to a non-existent directory
- `Plugin my-plugin has conflicting manifests: both plugin.json and marketplace entry specify components.`: remove duplicate component definitions or set `strict: true` in marketplace entry

### [​](#hook-troubleshooting) Hook troubleshooting

**Hook script not executing**:

1. Check the script is executable: `chmod +x ./scripts/your-script.sh`
2. Verify the shebang line: First line should be `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
3. Check the path uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`: `"command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/your-script.sh"`
4. Test the script manually: `./scripts/your-script.sh`

**Hook not triggering on expected events**:

1. Verify the event name is correct (case-sensitive): `PostToolUse`, not `postToolUse`
2. Check the matcher pattern matches your tools: `"matcher": "Write|Edit"` for file operations
3. Confirm the hook type is valid: `command`, `prompt`, or `agent`

### [​](#mcp-server-troubleshooting) MCP server troubleshooting

**Server not starting**:

1. Check the command exists and is executable
2. Verify all paths use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable
3. Check the MCP server logs: `claude --debug` shows initialization errors
4. Test the server manually outside of Claude Code

**Server tools not appearing**:

1. Ensure the server is properly configured in `.mcp.json` or `plugin.json`
2. Verify the server implements the MCP protocol correctly
3. Check for connection timeouts in debug output

### [​](#directory-structure-mistakes) Directory structure mistakes

**Symptoms**: Plugin loads but components (commands, agents, hooks) are missing.
**Correct structure**: Components must be at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`. Only `plugin.json` belongs in `.claude-plugin/`.

```bash
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json      ← Only manifest here
├── commands/            ← At root level
├── agents/              ← At root level
└── hooks/               ← At root level
```

If your components are inside `.claude-plugin/`, move them to the plugin root.
**Debug checklist**:

1. Run `claude --debug` and look for “loading plugin” messages
2. Check that each component directory is listed in the debug output
3. Verify file permissions allow reading the plugin files

## [​](#distribution-and-versioning-reference) Distribution and versioning reference

### [​](#version-management) Version management

Follow semantic versioning for plugin releases:

```bash
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "2.1.0"
}
```

**Version format**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (incompatible API changes)
- **MINOR**: New features (backward-compatible additions)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward-compatible fixes)

**Best practices**:

- Start at `1.0.0` for your first stable release
- Update the version in `plugin.json` before distributing changes
- Document changes in a `CHANGELOG.md` file
- Use pre-release versions like `2.0.0-beta.1` for testing

Plugins let you extend Claude Code with custom functionality that can be shared across projects and teams. This guide covers creating your own plugins with slash commands, agents, Skills, hooks, and MCP servers.
Looking to install existing plugins? See [Discover and install plugins](/docs/en/discover-plugins). For complete technical specifications, see [Plugins reference](/docs/en/plugins-reference).

## [​](#when-to-use-plugins-vs-standalone-configuration) When to use plugins vs standalone configuration

Claude Code supports two ways to add custom slash commands, agents, and hooks:

| Approach | Slash command names | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Standalone** (`.claude/` directory) | `/hello` | Personal workflows, project-specific customizations, quick experiments |
| **Plugins** (directories with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) | `/plugin-name:hello` | Sharing with teammates, distributing to community, versioned releases, reusable across projects |

**Use standalone configuration when**:

- You’re customizing Claude Code for a single project
- The configuration is personal and doesn’t need to be shared
- You’re experimenting with slash commands or hooks before packaging them
- You want short slash command names like `/hello` or `/review`

**Use plugins when**:

- You want to share functionality with your team or community
- You need the same slash commands/agents across multiple projects
- You want version control and easy updates for your extensions
- You’re distributing through a marketplace
- You’re okay with namespaced slash commands like `/my-plugin:hello` (namespacing prevents conflicts between plugins)

Start with standalone configuration in `.claude/` for quick iteration, then [convert to a plugin](#convert-existing-configurations-to-plugins) when you’re ready to share.

## [​](#quickstart) Quickstart

This quickstart walks you through creating a plugin with a custom slash command. You’ll create a manifest (the configuration file that defines your plugin), add a slash command, and test it locally using the `--plugin-dir` flag.

### [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

- Claude Code [installed and authenticated](/docs/en/quickstart#step-1-install-claude-code)
- Claude Code version 1.0.33 or later (run `claude --version` to check)

If you don’t see the `/plugin` command, update Claude Code to the latest version. See [Troubleshooting](/docs/en/troubleshooting) for upgrade instructions.

### [​](#create-your-first-plugin) Create your first plugin

1

Create the plugin directory

Every plugin lives in its own directory containing a manifest and your custom commands, agents, or hooks. Create one now:

```bash
mkdir my-first-plugin
```

2

Create the plugin manifest

The manifest file at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` defines your plugin’s identity: its name, description, and version. Claude Code uses this metadata to display your plugin in the plugin manager.Create the `.claude-plugin` directory inside your plugin folder:

```bash
mkdir my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin
```

Then create `my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with this content:

my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json

```bash
{
"name": "my-first-plugin",
"description": "A greeting plugin to learn the basics",
"version": "1.0.0",
"author": {
"name": "Your Name"
}
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Unique identifier and slash command namespace. Slash commands are prefixed with this (e.g., `/my-first-plugin:hello`). |
| `description` | Shown in the plugin manager when browsing or installing plugins. |
| `version` | Track releases using [semantic versioning](/docs/en/plugins-reference#version-management). |
| `author` | Optional. Helpful for attribution. |

For additional fields like `homepage`, `repository`, and `license`, see the [full manifest schema](/docs/en/plugins-reference#plugin-manifest-schema).

3

Add a slash command

Slash commands are Markdown files in the `commands/` directory. The filename becomes the slash command name, prefixed with the plugin’s namespace (`hello.md` in a plugin named `my-first-plugin` creates `/my-first-plugin:hello`). The Markdown content tells Claude how to respond when someone runs the slash command.Create a `commands` directory in your plugin folder:

```bash
mkdir my-first-plugin/commands
```

Then create `my-first-plugin/commands/hello.md` with this content:

my-first-plugin/commands/hello.md

```bash
---
description: Greet the user with a friendly message
---

# Hello Command

Greet the user warmly and ask how you can help them today.
```

4

Test your plugin

Run Claude Code with the `--plugin-dir` flag to load your plugin:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./my-first-plugin
```

Once Claude Code starts, try your new command:

```bash
/my-first-plugin:hello
```

You’ll see Claude respond with a greeting. Run `/help` to see your command listed under the plugin namespace.

**Why namespacing?** Plugin slash commands are always namespaced (like `/greet:hello`) to prevent conflicts when multiple plugins have commands with the same name.To change the namespace prefix, update the `name` field in `plugin.json`.

5

Add slash command arguments

Make your slash command dynamic by accepting user input. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder captures any text the user provides after the slash command.Update your `hello.md` file:

my-first-plugin/commands/hello.md

```bash
---
description: Greet the user with a personalized message
---

# Hello Command

Greet the user named "$ARGUMENTS" warmly and ask how you can help them today. Make the greeting personal and encouraging.
```

Restart Claude Code to pick up the changes, then try the command with your name:

```bash
/my-first-plugin:hello Alex
```

Claude will greet you by name. For more argument options like `$1`, `$2` for individual parameters, see [Slash commands](/docs/en/slash-commands).

You’ve successfully created and tested a plugin with these key components:

- **Plugin manifest** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`): describes your plugin’s metadata
- **Commands directory** (`commands/`): contains your custom slash commands
- **Command arguments** (`$ARGUMENTS`): captures user input for dynamic behavior

The `--plugin-dir` flag is useful for development and testing. When you’re ready to share your plugin with others, see [Create and distribute a plugin marketplace](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).

## [​](#plugin-structure-overview) Plugin structure overview

You’ve created a plugin with a slash command, but plugins can include much more: custom agents, Skills, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers.

**Common mistake**: Don’t put `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, or `hooks/` inside the `.claude-plugin/` directory. Only `plugin.json` goes inside `.claude-plugin/`. All other directories must be at the plugin root level.

| Directory | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.claude-plugin/` | Plugin root | Contains only `plugin.json` manifest (required) |
| `commands/` | Plugin root | Slash commands as Markdown files |
| `agents/` | Plugin root | Custom agent definitions |
| `skills/` | Plugin root | Agent Skills with `SKILL.md` files |
| `hooks/` | Plugin root | Event handlers in `hooks.json` |
| `.mcp.json` | Plugin root | MCP server configurations |
| `.lsp.json` | Plugin root | LSP server configurations for code intelligence |

**Next steps**: Ready to add more features? Jump to [Develop more complex plugins](#develop-more-complex-plugins) to add agents, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers. For complete technical specifications of all plugin components, see [Plugins reference](/docs/en/plugins-reference).

## [​](#develop-more-complex-plugins) Develop more complex plugins

Once you’re comfortable with basic plugins, you can create more sophisticated extensions.

### [​](#add-skills-to-your-plugin) Add Skills to your plugin

Plugins can include [Agent Skills](/docs/en/skills) to extend Claude’s capabilities. Skills are model-invoked: Claude automatically uses them based on the task context.
Add a `skills/` directory at your plugin root with Skill folders containing `SKILL.md` files:

```bash
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
└── skills/
    └── code-review/
        └── SKILL.md
```

Each `SKILL.md` needs frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields, followed by instructions:

```bash
---
name: code-review
description: Reviews code for best practices and potential issues. Use when reviewing code, checking PRs, or analyzing code quality.
---

When reviewing code, check for:
1. Code organization and structure
2. Error handling
3. Security concerns
4. Test coverage
```

After installing the plugin, restart Claude Code to load the Skills. For complete Skill authoring guidance including progressive disclosure and tool restrictions, see [Agent Skills](/docs/en/skills).

### [​](#add-lsp-servers-to-your-plugin) Add LSP servers to your plugin

For common languages like TypeScript, Python, and Rust, install the pre-built LSP plugins from the official marketplace. Create custom LSP plugins only when you need support for languages not already covered.

LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugins give Claude real-time code intelligence. If you need to support a language that doesn’t have an official LSP plugin, you can create your own by adding an `.lsp.json` file to your plugin:

.lsp.json

```bash
{
  "go": {
    "command": "gopls",
    "args": ["serve"],
    "extensionToLanguage": {
      ".go": "go"
    }
  }
}
```

Users installing your plugin must have the language server binary installed on their machine.
For complete LSP configuration options, see [LSP servers](/docs/en/plugins-reference#lsp-servers).

### [​](#organize-complex-plugins) Organize complex plugins

For plugins with many components, organize your directory structure by functionality. For complete directory layouts and organization patterns, see [Plugin directory structure](/docs/en/plugins-reference#plugin-directory-structure).

### [​](#test-your-plugins-locally) Test your plugins locally

Use the `--plugin-dir` flag to test plugins during development. This loads your plugin directly without requiring installation.

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./my-plugin
```

As you make changes to your plugin, restart Claude Code to pick up the updates. Test your plugin components:

- Try your commands with `/command-name`
- Check that agents appear in `/agents`
- Verify hooks work as expected

You can load multiple plugins at once by specifying the flag multiple times:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugin-one --plugin-dir ./plugin-two
```

### [​](#debug-plugin-issues) Debug plugin issues

If your plugin isn’t working as expected:

1. **Check the structure**: Ensure your directories are at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`
2. **Test components individually**: Check each command, agent, and hook separately
3. **Use validation and debugging tools**: See [Debugging and development tools](/docs/en/plugins-reference#debugging-and-development-tools) for CLI commands and troubleshooting techniques

### [​](#share-your-plugins) Share your plugins

When your plugin is ready to share:

1. **Add documentation**: Include a `README.md` with installation and usage instructions
2. **Version your plugin**: Use [semantic versioning](/docs/en/plugins-reference#version-management) in your `plugin.json`
3. **Create or use a marketplace**: Distribute through [plugin marketplaces](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) for installation
4. **Test with others**: Have team members test the plugin before wider distribution

Once your plugin is in a marketplace, others can install it using the instructions in [Discover and install plugins](/docs/en/discover-plugins).

For complete technical specifications, debugging techniques, and distribution strategies, see [Plugins reference](/docs/en/plugins-reference).

## [​](#convert-existing-configurations-to-plugins) Convert existing configurations to plugins

If you already have custom commands, Skills, or hooks in your `.claude/` directory, you can convert them into a plugin for easier sharing and distribution.

### [​](#migration-steps) Migration steps

1

Create the plugin structure

Create a new plugin directory:

```bash
mkdir -p my-plugin/.claude-plugin
```

Create the manifest file at `my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:

my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json

```bash
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "description": "Migrated from standalone configuration",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

2

Copy your existing files

Copy your existing configurations to the plugin directory:

```bash
# Copy commands
cp -r .claude/commands my-plugin/

# Copy agents (if any)
cp -r .claude/agents my-plugin/

# Copy skills (if any)
cp -r .claude/skills my-plugin/
```

3

Migrate hooks

If you have hooks in your settings, create a hooks directory:

```bash
mkdir my-plugin/hooks
```

Create `my-plugin/hooks/hooks.json` with your hooks configuration. Copy the `hooks` object from your `.claude/settings.json` or `settings.local.json`—the format is the same:

my-plugin/hooks/hooks.json

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "npm run lint:fix $FILE" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

4

Test your migrated plugin

Load your plugin to verify everything works:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./my-plugin
```

Test each component: run your commands, check agents appear in `/agents`, and verify hooks trigger correctly.

### [​](#what-changes-when-migrating) What changes when migrating

| Standalone (`.claude/`) | Plugin |
| --- | --- |
| Only available in one project | Can be shared via marketplaces |
| Files in `.claude/commands/` | Files in `plugin-name/commands/` |
| Hooks in `settings.json` | Hooks in `hooks/hooks.json` |
| Must manually copy to share | Install with `/plugin install` |

After migrating, you can remove the original files from `.claude/` to avoid duplicates. The plugin version will take precedence when loaded.

This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in just a few minutes. By the end, you’ll understand how to use Claude Code for common development tasks.

## [​](#before-you-begin) Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A terminal or command prompt open
- A code project to work with
- A [Claude subscription](https://claude.com/pricing) (Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise) or [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) account

## [​](#step-1:-install-claude-code) Step 1: Install Claude Code

To install Claude Code, use one of the following methods:

- Native Install (Recommended)
- Homebrew
- WinGet

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```bash
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows CMD:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

Native installations automatically update in the background to keep you on the latest version.

```bash
brew install --cask claude-code
```

Homebrew installations do not auto-update. Run `brew upgrade claude-code` periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.

```bash
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

WinGet installations do not auto-update. Run `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.

## [​](#step-2:-log-in-to-your-account) Step 2: Log in to your account

Claude Code requires an account to use. When you start an interactive session with the `claude` command, you’ll need to log in:

```bash
claude
# You'll be prompted to log in on first use
```

```bash
/login
# Follow the prompts to log in with your account
```

You can log in using any of these account types:

- [Claude Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise](https://claude.com/pricing) (recommended)
- [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) (API access with pre-paid credits)

Once logged in, your credentials are stored and you won’t need to log in again.

When you first authenticate Claude Code with your Claude Console account, a workspace called “Claude Code” is automatically created for you. This workspace provides centralized cost tracking and management for all Claude Code usage in your organization.

You can have both account types under the same email address. If you need to log in again or switch accounts, use the `/login` command within Claude Code.

## [​](#step-3:-start-your-first-session) Step 3: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

You’ll see the Claude Code welcome screen with your session information, recent conversations, and latest updates. Type `/help` for available commands or `/resume` to continue a previous conversation.

After logging in (Step 2), your credentials are stored on your system. Learn more in [Credential Management](/docs/en/iam#credential-management).

## [​](#step-4:-ask-your-first-question) Step 4: Ask your first question

Let’s start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

```bash
> what does this project do?
```

Claude will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

```bash
> what technologies does this project use?
```

```bash
> where is the main entry point?
```

```bash
> explain the folder structure
```

You can also ask Claude about its own capabilities:

```bash
> what can Claude Code do?
```

```bash
> how do I use slash commands in Claude Code?
```

```bash
> can Claude Code work with Docker?
```

Claude Code reads your files as needed - you don’t have to manually add context. Claude also has access to its own documentation and can answer questions about its features and capabilities.

## [​](#step-5:-make-your-first-code-change) Step 5: Make your first code change

Now let’s make Claude Code do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

```bash
> add a hello world function to the main file
```

Claude Code will:

1. Find the appropriate file
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your approval
4. Make the edit

Claude Code always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable “Accept all” mode for a session.

## [​](#step-6:-use-git-with-claude-code) Step 6: Use Git with Claude Code

Claude Code makes Git operations conversational:

```bash
> what files have I changed?
```

```bash
> commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

```bash
> create a new branch called feature/quickstart
```

```bash
> show me the last 5 commits
```

```bash
> help me resolve merge conflicts
```

## [​](#step-7:-fix-a-bug-or-add-a-feature) Step 7: Fix a bug or add a feature

Claude is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.
Describe what you want in natural language:

```bash
> add input validation to the user registration form
```

Or fix existing issues:

```bash
> there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
```

Claude Code will:

- Locate the relevant code
- Understand the context
- Implement a solution
- Run tests if available

## [​](#step-8:-test-out-other-common-workflows) Step 8: Test out other common workflows

There are a number of ways to work with Claude:
**Refactor code**

```bash
> refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Write tests**

```bash
> write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

**Update documentation**

```bash
> update the README with installation instructions
```

**Code review**

```bash
> review my changes and suggest improvements
```

**Remember**: Claude Code is your AI pair programmer. Talk to it like you would a helpful colleague - describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.

title: Sandboxing

## [​](#overview) Overview

Claude Code features native sandboxing to provide a more secure environment for agent execution while reducing the need for constant permission prompts. Instead of asking permission for each bash command, sandboxing creates defined boundaries upfront where Claude Code can work more freely with reduced risk.
The sandboxed bash tool uses OS-level primitives to enforce both filesystem and network isolation.

## [​](#why-sandboxing-matters) Why sandboxing matters

Traditional permission-based security requires constant user approval for bash commands. While this provides control, it can lead to:

- **Approval fatigue**: Repeatedly clicking “approve” can cause users to pay less attention to what they’re approving
- **Reduced productivity**: Constant interruptions slow down development workflows
- **Limited autonomy**: Claude Code cannot work as efficiently when waiting for approvals

Sandboxing addresses these challenges by:

1. **Defining clear boundaries**: Specify exactly which directories and network hosts Claude Code can access
2. **Reducing permission prompts**: Safe commands within the sandbox don’t require approval
3. **Maintaining security**: Attempts to access resources outside the sandbox trigger immediate notifications
4. **Enabling autonomy**: Claude Code can run more independently within defined limits

Effective sandboxing requires **both** filesystem and network isolation. Without network isolation, a compromised agent could exfiltrate sensitive files like SSH keys. Without filesystem isolation, a compromised agent could backdoor system resources to gain network access. When configuring sandboxing it is important to ensure that your configured settings do not create bypasses in these systems.

## [​](#how-it-works) How it works

### [​](#filesystem-isolation) Filesystem isolation

The sandboxed bash tool restricts file system access to specific directories:

- **Default writes behavior**: Read and write access to the current working directory and its subdirectories
- **Default read behavior**: Read access to the entire computer, except certain denied directories
- **Blocked access**: Cannot modify files outside the current working directory without explicit permission
- **Configurable**: Define custom allowed and denied paths through settings

### [​](#network-isolation) Network isolation

Network access is controlled through a proxy server running outside the sandbox:

- **Domain restrictions**: Only approved domains can be accessed
- **User confirmation**: New domain requests trigger permission prompts
- **Custom proxy support**: Advanced users can implement custom rules on outgoing traffic
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Restrictions apply to all scripts, programs, and subprocesses spawned by commands

### [​](#os-level-enforcement) OS-level enforcement

The sandboxed bash tool leverages operating system security primitives:

- **Linux**: Uses [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) for isolation
- **macOS**: Uses Seatbelt for sandbox enforcement

These OS-level restrictions ensure that all child processes spawned by Claude Code’s commands inherit the same security boundaries.

## [​](#getting-started) Getting started

### [​](#enable-sandboxing) Enable sandboxing

You can enable sandboxing by running the `/sandbox` slash command:

```bash
> /sandbox
```

This opens a menu where you can choose between sandbox modes.

### [​](#sandbox-modes) Sandbox modes

Claude Code offers two sandbox modes:
**Auto-allow mode**: Bash commands will attempt to run inside the sandbox and are automatically allowed without requiring permission. Commands that cannot be sandboxed (such as those needing network access to non-allowed hosts) fall back to the regular permission flow. Explicit ask/deny rules you’ve configured are always respected.
**Regular permissions mode**: All bash commands go through the standard permission flow, even when sandboxed. This provides more control but requires more approvals.
In both modes, the sandbox enforces the same filesystem and network restrictions. The difference is only in whether sandboxed commands are auto-approved or require explicit permission.

Auto-allow mode works independently of your permission mode setting. Even if you’re not in “accept edits” mode, sandboxed bash commands will run automatically when auto-allow is enabled. This means bash commands that modify files within the sandbox boundaries will execute without prompting, even when file edit tools would normally require approval.

### [​](#configure-sandboxing) Configure sandboxing

Customize sandbox behavior through your `settings.json` file. See [Settings](/docs/en/settings#sandbox-settings) for complete configuration reference.

Not all commands are compatible with sandboxing out of the box. Some notes that may help you make the most out of the sandbox:

- Many CLI tools require accessing certain hosts. As you use these tools, they will request permission to access certain hosts. Granting permission will allow them to access these hosts now and in the future, enabling them to safely execute inside the sandbox.
- `watchman` is incompatible with running in the sandbox. If you’re running `jest`, consider using `jest --no-watchman`
- `docker` is incompatible with running in the sandbox. Consider specifying `docker` in `excludedCommands` to force it to run outside of the sandbox.

Claude Code includes an intentional escape hatch mechanism that allows commands to run outside the sandbox when necessary. When a command fails due to sandbox restrictions (such as network connectivity issues or incompatible tools), Claude is prompted to analyze the failure and may retry the command with the `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` parameter. Commands that use this parameter go through the normal Claude Code permissions flow requiring user permission to execute. This allows Claude Code to handle edge cases where certain tools or network operations cannot function within sandbox constraints.You can disable this escape hatch by setting `"allowUnsandboxedCommands": false` in your [sandbox settings](/docs/en/settings#sandbox-settings). When disabled, the `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` parameter is completely ignored and all commands must run sandboxed or be explicitly listed in `excludedCommands`.

## [​](#security-benefits) Security benefits

### [​](#protection-against-prompt-injection) Protection against prompt injection

Even if an attacker successfully manipulates Claude Code’s behavior through prompt injection, the sandbox ensures your system remains secure:
**Filesystem protection:**

- Cannot modify critical config files such as `~/.bashrc`
- Cannot modify system-level files in `/bin/`
- Cannot read files that are denied in your [Claude permission settings](/docs/en/iam#configuring-permissions)

**Network protection:**

- Cannot exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled servers
- Cannot download malicious scripts from unauthorized domains
- Cannot make unexpected API calls to unapproved services
- Cannot contact any domains not explicitly allowed

**Monitoring and control:**

- All access attempts outside the sandbox are blocked at the OS level
- You receive immediate notifications when boundaries are tested
- You can choose to deny, allow once, or permanently update your configuration

### [​](#reduced-attack-surface) Reduced attack surface

Sandboxing limits the potential damage from:

- **Malicious dependencies**: NPM packages or other dependencies with harmful code
- **Compromised scripts**: Build scripts or tools with security vulnerabilities
- **Social engineering**: Attacks that trick users into running dangerous commands
- **Prompt injection**: Attacks that trick Claude into running dangerous commands

### [​](#transparent-operation) Transparent operation

When Claude Code attempts to access network resources outside the sandbox:

1. The operation is blocked at the OS level
2. You receive an immediate notification
3. You can choose to:
   - Deny the request
   - Allow it once
   - Update your sandbox configuration to permanently allow it

## [​](#security-limitations) Security Limitations

- Network Sandboxing Limitations: The network filtering system operates by restricting the domains that processes are allowed to connect to. It does not otherwise inspect the traffic passing through the proxy and users are responsible for ensuring they only allow trusted domains in their policy.

Users should be aware of potential risks that come from allowing broad domains like `github.com` that may allow for data exfiltration. Also, in some cases it may be possible to bypass the network filtering through [domain fronting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_fronting).

- Privilege Escalation via Unix Sockets: The `allowUnixSockets` configuration can inadvertently grant access to powerful system services that could lead to sandbox bypasses. For example, if it is used to allow access to `/var/run/docker.sock` this would effectively grant access to the host system through exploiting the docker socket. Users are encouraged to carefully consider any unix sockets that they allow through the sandbox.
- Filesystem Permission Escalation: Overly broad filesystem write permissions can enable privilege escalation attacks. Allowing writes to directories containing executables in `$PATH`, system configuration directories, or user shell configuration files (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) can lead to code execution in different security contexts when other users or system processes access these files.
- Linux Sandbox Strength: The Linux implementation provides strong filesystem and network isolation but includes an `enableWeakerNestedSandbox` mode that enables it to work inside of Docker environments without privileged namespaces. This option considerably weakens security and should only be used in cases where additional isolation is otherwise enforced.

## [​](#advanced-usage) Advanced usage

### [​](#custom-proxy-configuration) Custom proxy configuration

For organizations requiring advanced network security, you can implement a custom proxy to:

- Decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic
- Apply custom filtering rules
- Log all network requests
- Integrate with existing security infrastructure

```bash
{
  "sandbox": {
    "network": {
      "httpProxyPort": 8080,
      "socksProxyPort": 8081
    }
  }
}
```

### [​](#integration-with-existing-security-tools) Integration with existing security tools

The sandboxed bash tool works alongside:

- **IAM policies**: Combine with [permission settings](/docs/en/iam) for defense-in-depth
- **Development containers**: Use with [devcontainers](/docs/en/devcontainer) for additional isolation
- **Enterprise policies**: Enforce sandbox configurations through [managed settings](/docs/en/settings#settings-precedence)

## [​](#best-practices) Best practices

1. **Start restrictive**: Begin with minimal permissions and expand as needed
2. **Monitor logs**: Review sandbox violation attempts to understand Claude Code’s needs
3. **Use environment-specific configs**: Different sandbox rules for development vs. production contexts
4. **Combine with permissions**: Use sandboxing alongside IAM policies for comprehensive security
5. **Test configurations**: Verify your sandbox settings don’t block legitimate workflows

## [​](#open-source) Open source

The sandbox runtime is available as an open source npm package for use in your own agent projects. This enables the broader AI agent community to build safer, more secure autonomous systems. This can also be used to sandbox other programs you may wish to run. For example, to sandbox an MCP server you could run:

```bash
npx @anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime <command-to-sandbox>
```

For implementation details and source code, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime).

## [​](#limitations) Limitations

- **Performance overhead**: Minimal, but some filesystem operations may be slightly slower
- **Compatibility**: Some tools that require specific system access patterns may need configuration adjustments, or may even need to be run outside of the sandbox
- **Platform support**: Currently supports Linux and macOS; Windows support planned

## [​](#how-we-approach-security) How we approach security

### [​](#security-foundation) Security foundation

Your code’s security is paramount. Claude Code is built with security at its core, developed according to Anthropic’s comprehensive security program. Learn more and access resources (SOC 2 Type 2 report, ISO 27001 certificate, etc.) at [Anthropic Trust Center](https://trust.anthropic.com).

### [​](#permission-based-architecture) Permission-based architecture

Claude Code uses strict read-only permissions by default. When additional actions are needed (editing files, running tests, executing commands), Claude Code requests explicit permission. Users control whether to approve actions once or allow them automatically.
We designed Claude Code to be transparent and secure. For example, we require approval for bash commands before executing them, giving you direct control. This approach enables users and organizations to configure permissions directly.
For detailed permission configuration, see [Identity and Access Management](/docs/en/iam).

### [​](#built-in-protections) Built-in protections

To mitigate risks in agentic systems:

- **Sandboxed bash tool**: [Sandbox](/docs/en/sandboxing) bash commands with filesystem and network isolation, reducing permission prompts while maintaining security. Enable with `/sandbox` to define boundaries where Claude Code can work autonomously
- **Write access restriction**: Claude Code can only write to the folder where it was started and its subfolders—it cannot modify files in parent directories without explicit permission. While Claude Code can read files outside the working directory (useful for accessing system libraries and dependencies), write operations are strictly confined to the project scope, creating a clear security boundary
- **Prompt fatigue mitigation**: Support for allowlisting frequently used safe commands per-user, per-codebase, or per-organization
- **Accept Edits mode**: Batch accept multiple edits while maintaining permission prompts for commands with side effects

### [​](#user-responsibility) User responsibility

Claude Code only has the permissions you grant it. You’re responsible for reviewing proposed code and commands for safety before approval.

## [​](#protect-against-prompt-injection) Protect against prompt injection

Prompt injection is a technique where an attacker attempts to override or manipulate an AI assistant’s instructions by inserting malicious text. Claude Code includes several safeguards against these attacks:

### [​](#core-protections) Core protections

- **Permission system**: Sensitive operations require explicit approval
- **Context-aware analysis**: Detects potentially harmful instructions by analyzing the full request
- **Input sanitization**: Prevents command injection by processing user inputs
- **Command blocklist**: Blocks risky commands that fetch arbitrary content from the web like `curl` and `wget` by default. When explicitly allowed, be aware of [permission pattern limitations](/docs/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules)

### [​](#privacy-safeguards) Privacy safeguards

We have implemented several safeguards to protect your data, including:

- Limited retention periods for sensitive information (see the [Privacy Center](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023548-how-long-do-you-store-my-data) to learn more)
- Restricted access to user session data
- User control over data training preferences. Consumer users can change their [privacy settings](https://claude.ai/settings/privacy) at any time.

For full details, please review our [Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms) (for Team, Enterprise, and API users) or [Consumer Terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/consumer-terms) (for Free, Pro, and Max users) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy).

### [​](#additional-safeguards) Additional safeguards

- **Network request approval**: Tools that make network requests require user approval by default
- **Isolated context windows**: Web fetch uses a separate context window to avoid injecting potentially malicious prompts
- **Trust verification**: First-time codebase runs and new MCP servers require trust verification
  - Note: Trust verification is disabled when running non-interactively with the `-p` flag
- **Command injection detection**: Suspicious bash commands require manual approval even if previously allowlisted
- **Fail-closed matching**: Unmatched commands default to requiring manual approval
- **Natural language descriptions**: Complex bash commands include explanations for user understanding
- **Secure credential storage**: API keys and tokens are encrypted. See [Credential Management](/docs/en/iam#credential-management)

**Windows WebDAV security risk**: When running Claude Code on Windows, we recommend against enabling WebDAV or allowing Claude Code to access paths such as `\\*` that may contain WebDAV subdirectories. [WebDAV has been deprecated by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features#:~:text=The%20Webclient%20(WebDAV)%20service%20is%20deprecated) due to security risks. Enabling WebDAV may allow Claude Code to trigger network requests to remote hosts, bypassing the permission system.

**Best practices for working with untrusted content**:

1. Review suggested commands before approval
2. Avoid piping untrusted content directly to Claude
3. Verify proposed changes to critical files
4. Use virtual machines (VMs) to run scripts and make tool calls, especially when interacting with external web services
5. Report suspicious behavior with `/bug`

While these protections significantly reduce risk, no system is completely
immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices when working
with any AI tool.

## [​](#mcp-security) MCP security

Claude Code allows users to configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The list of allowed MCP servers is configured in your source code, as part of Claude Code settings engineers check into source control.
We encourage either writing your own MCP servers or using MCP servers from providers that you trust. You are able to configure Claude Code permissions for MCP servers. Anthropic does not manage or audit any MCP servers.

## [​](#ide-security) IDE security

See [here](/docs/en/vs-code#security) for more information on the security of running Claude Code in an IDE.

## [​](#cloud-execution-security) Cloud execution security

When using [Claude Code on the web](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web), additional security controls are in place:

- **Isolated virtual machines**: Each cloud session runs in an isolated, Anthropic-managed VM
- **Network access controls**: Network access is limited by default and can be configured to be disabled or allow only specific domains
- **Credential protection**: Authentication is handled through a secure proxy that uses a scoped credential inside the sandbox, which is then translated to your actual GitHub authentication token
- **Branch restrictions**: Git push operations are restricted to the current working branch
- **Audit logging**: All operations in cloud environments are logged for compliance and audit purposes
- **Automatic cleanup**: Cloud environments are automatically terminated after session completion

For more details on cloud execution, see [Claude Code on the web](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web).

## [​](#security-best-practices) Security best practices

### [​](#working-with-sensitive-code) Working with sensitive code

- Review all suggested changes before approval
- Use project-specific permission settings for sensitive repositories
- Consider using [devcontainers](/docs/en/devcontainer) for additional isolation
- Regularly audit your permission settings with `/permissions`

### [​](#team-security) Team security

- Use [managed settings](/docs/en/iam#managed-settings) to enforce organizational standards
- Share approved permission configurations through version control
- Train team members on security best practices
- Monitor Claude Code usage through [OpenTelemetry metrics](/docs/en/monitoring-usage)

### [​](#reporting-security-issues) Reporting security issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in Claude Code:

1. Do not disclose it publicly
2. Report it through our [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/anthropic-vdp/reports/new?type=team&report_type=vulnerability)
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow time for us to address the issue before public disclosure

Claude Code offers a variety of settings to configure its behavior to meet your needs. You can configure Claude Code by running the `/config` command when using the interactive REPL, which opens a tabbed Settings interface where you can view status information and modify configuration options.

## [​](#configuration-scopes) Configuration scopes

Claude Code uses a **scope system** to determine where configurations apply and who they’re shared with. Understanding scopes helps you decide how to configure Claude Code for personal use, team collaboration, or enterprise deployment.

### [​](#available-scopes) Available scopes

| Scope | Location | Who it affects | Shared with team? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Managed** | System-level `managed-settings.json` | All users on the machine | Yes (deployed by IT) |
| **User** | `~/.claude/` directory | You, across all projects | No |
| **Project** | `.claude/` in repository | All collaborators on this repository | Yes (committed to git) |
| **Local** | `.claude/*.local.*` files | You, in this repository only | No (gitignored) |

### [​](#when-to-use-each-scope) When to use each scope

**Managed scope** is for:

- Security policies that must be enforced organization-wide
- Compliance requirements that can’t be overridden
- Standardized configurations deployed by IT/DevOps

**User scope** is best for:

- Personal preferences you want everywhere (themes, editor settings)
- Tools and plugins you use across all projects
- API keys and authentication (stored securely)

**Project scope** is best for:

- Team-shared settings (permissions, hooks, MCP servers)
- Plugins the whole team should have
- Standardizing tooling across collaborators

**Local scope** is best for:

- Personal overrides for a specific project
- Testing configurations before sharing with the team
- Machine-specific settings that won’t work for others

### [​](#how-scopes-interact) How scopes interact

When the same setting is configured in multiple scopes, more specific scopes take precedence:

1. **Managed** (highest) - can’t be overridden by anything
2. **Command line arguments** - temporary session overrides
3. **Local** - overrides project and user settings
4. **Project** - overrides user settings
5. **User** (lowest) - applies when nothing else specifies the setting

For example, if a permission is allowed in user settings but denied in project settings, the project setting takes precedence and the permission is blocked.

### [​](#what-uses-scopes) What uses scopes

Scopes apply to many Claude Code features:

| Feature | User location | Project location | Local location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Settings** | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.local.json` |
| **Subagents** | `~/.claude/agents/` | `.claude/agents/` | — |
| **MCP servers** | `~/.claude.json` | `.mcp.json` | `~/.claude.json` (per-project) |
| **Plugins** | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.local.json` |
| **CLAUDE.md** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.local.md` |

---

## [​](#settings-files) Settings files

The `settings.json` file is our official mechanism for configuring Claude
Code through hierarchical settings:

- **User settings** are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` and apply to all
  projects.
- **Project settings** are saved in your project directory:
  - `.claude/settings.json` for settings that are checked into source control and shared with your team
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` for settings that are not checked in, useful for personal preferences and experimentation. Claude Code will configure git to ignore `.claude/settings.local.json` when it is created.
- **Managed settings**: For organizations that need centralized control, Claude Code supports `managed-settings.json` and `managed-mcp.json` files that can be deployed to system directories:
  - macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/`
  - Linux and WSL: `/etc/claude-code/`
  - Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\`

  These are system-wide paths (not user home directories like `~/Library/...`) that require administrator privileges. They are designed to be deployed by IT administrators.

  See [Managed settings](/docs/en/iam#managed-settings) and [Managed MCP configuration](/docs/en/mcp#managed-mcp-configuration) for details.

  Managed deployments can also restrict **plugin marketplace additions** using
  `strictKnownMarketplaces`. For more information, see [Managed marketplace restrictions](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions).
- **Other configuration** is stored in `~/.claude.json`. This file contains your preferences (theme, notification settings, editor mode), OAuth session, [MCP server](/docs/en/mcp) configurations for user and local scopes, per-project state (allowed tools, trust settings), and various caches. Project-scoped MCP servers are stored separately in `.mcp.json`.

Example settings.json

```bash
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run lint)",
      "Bash(npm run test:*)",
      "Read(~/.zshrc)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(curl:*)",
      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)",
      "Read(./secrets/**)"
    ]
  },
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp"
  },
  "companyAnnouncements": [
    "Welcome to Acme Corp! Review our code guidelines at docs.acme.com",
    "Reminder: Code reviews required for all PRs",
    "New security policy in effect"
  ]
}
```

| `terminalProgressBarEnabled` | Enable the terminal progress bar that shows progress in supported terminals like Windows Terminal and iTerm2 (default: `true`) | `false` |

### [​](#permission-settings) Permission settings

| Keys | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allow` | Array of permission rules to allow tool use. See [Permission rule syntax](#permission-rule-syntax) below for pattern matching details | `[ "Bash(git diff:*)" ]` |
| `ask` | Array of permission rules to ask for confirmation upon tool use. See [Permission rule syntax](#permission-rule-syntax) below | `[ "Bash(git push:*)" ]` |
| `deny` | Array of permission rules to deny tool use. Use this to exclude sensitive files from Claude Code access. See [Permission rule syntax](#permission-rule-syntax) and [Bash permission limitations](/docs/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules) | `[ "WebFetch", "Bash(curl:*)", "Read(./.env)", "Read(./secrets/**)" ]` |
| `additionalDirectories` | Additional [working directories](/docs/en/iam#working-directories) that Claude has access to | `[ "../docs/" ]` |
| `defaultMode` | Default [permission mode](/docs/en/iam#permission-modes) when opening Claude Code | `"acceptEdits"` |
| `disableBypassPermissionsMode` | Set to `"disable"` to prevent `bypassPermissions` mode from being activated. This disables the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` command-line flag. See [managed settings](/docs/en/iam#managed-settings) | `"disable"` |

### [​](#permission-rule-syntax) Permission rule syntax

Permission rules follow the format `Tool` or `Tool(specifier)`. Understanding the syntax helps you write rules that match exactly what you intend.

#### [​](#rule-evaluation-order) Rule evaluation order

When multiple rules could match the same tool use, rules are evaluated in this order:

1. **Deny** rules are checked first
2. **Ask** rules are checked second
3. **Allow** rules are checked last

The first matching rule determines the behavior. This means deny rules always take precedence over allow rules, even if both match the same command.

#### [​](#matching-all-uses-of-a-tool) Matching all uses of a tool

To match all uses of a tool, use just the tool name without parentheses:

| Rule | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Bash` | Matches **all** Bash commands |
| `WebFetch` | Matches **all** web fetch requests |
| `Read` | Matches **all** file reads |

`Bash(*)` does **not** match all Bash commands. The `*` wildcard only matches within the specifier context. To allow or deny all uses of a tool, use just the tool name: `Bash`, not `Bash(*)`.

#### [​](#using-specifiers-for-fine-grained-control) Using specifiers for fine-grained control

Add a specifier in parentheses to match specific tool uses:

| Rule | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Bash(npm run build)` | Matches the exact command `npm run build` |
| `Read(./.env)` | Matches reading the `.env` file in the current directory |
| `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` | Matches fetch requests to example.com |

#### [​](#wildcard-patterns) Wildcard patterns

Two wildcard syntaxes are available for Bash rules:

| Wildcard | Position | Behavior | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `:*` | End of pattern only | **Prefix matching** - matches commands starting with the prefix | `Bash(npm run:*)` matches `npm run test`, `npm run build` |
| `*` | Anywhere in pattern | **Glob matching** - matches any sequence of characters at that position | `Bash(* install)` matches `npm install`, `yarn install` |

**Prefix matching with `:*`**
The `:*` suffix matches any command that starts with the specified prefix. This works with multi-word commands. The following configuration allows npm and git commit commands while blocking git push and rm -rf:

```bash
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run:*)",
      "Bash(git commit:*)",
      "Bash(docker compose:*)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(git push:*)",
      "Bash(rm -rf:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Glob matching with `*`**
The `*` wildcard can appear at the beginning, middle, or end of a pattern. The following configuration allows any git command targeting main (like `git checkout main`, `git merge main`) and any version check command (like `node --version`, `npm --version`):

```bash
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(git * main)",
      "Bash(* --version)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Bash permission rules use pattern matching and can be bypassed using shell features like command flags, variables, or redirects. For example, `Bash(curl:*)` can be bypassed with `curl -X GET` reordered to `curl http://example.com -X GET`. Do not rely on Bash deny rules as a security boundary.

For detailed information about tool-specific permission patterns—including Read, Edit, WebFetch, MCP, Task rules, and Bash permission limitations—see [Tool-specific permission rules](/docs/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules).

### [​](#sandbox-settings) Sandbox settings

Configure advanced sandboxing behavior. Sandboxing isolates bash commands from your filesystem and network. See [Sandboxing](/docs/en/sandboxing) for details.
**Filesystem and network restrictions** are configured via Read, Edit, and WebFetch permission rules, not via these sandbox settings.

| Keys | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Enable bash sandboxing (macOS/Linux only). Default: false | `true` |
| `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` | Auto-approve bash commands when sandboxed. Default: true | `true` |
| `excludedCommands` | Commands that should run outside of the sandbox | `["git", "docker"]` |
| `allowUnsandboxedCommands` | Allow commands to run outside the sandbox via the `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` parameter. When set to `false`, the `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` escape hatch is completely disabled and all commands must run sandboxed (or be in `excludedCommands`). Useful for enterprise policies that require strict sandboxing. Default: true | `false` |
| `network.allowUnixSockets` | Unix socket paths accessible in sandbox (for SSH agents, etc.) | `["~/.ssh/agent-socket"]` |
| `network.allowLocalBinding` | Allow binding to localhost ports (macOS only). Default: false | `true` |
| `network.httpProxyPort` | HTTP proxy port used if you wish to bring your own proxy. If not specified, Claude will run its own proxy. | `8080` |
| `network.socksProxyPort` | SOCKS5 proxy port used if you wish to bring your own proxy. If not specified, Claude will run its own proxy. | `8081` |
| `enableWeakerNestedSandbox` | Enable weaker sandbox for unprivileged Docker environments (Linux only). **Reduces security.** Default: false | `true` |

**Configuration example:**

```bash
{
  "sandbox": {
    "enabled": true,
    "autoAllowBashIfSandboxed": true,
    "excludedCommands": ["docker"],
    "network": {
      "allowUnixSockets": [
        "/var/run/docker.sock"
      ],
      "allowLocalBinding": true
    }
  },
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(.envrc)",
      "Read(~/.aws/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Filesystem and network restrictions** use standard permission rules:

- Use `Read` deny rules to block Claude from reading specific files or directories
- Use `Edit` allow rules to let Claude write to directories beyond the current working directory
- Use `Edit` deny rules to block writes to specific paths
- Use `WebFetch` allow/deny rules to control which network domains Claude can access

### [​](#attribution-settings) Attribution settings

Claude Code adds attribution to git commits and pull requests. These are configured separately:

- Commits use [git trailers](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers) (like `Co-Authored-By`) by default, which can be customized or disabled
- Pull request descriptions are plain text

| Keys | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `commit` | Attribution for git commits, including any trailers. Empty string hides commit attribution |
| `pr` | Attribution for pull request descriptions. Empty string hides pull request attribution |

**Default commit attribution:**

```bash
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <[email protected]>
```

**Default pull request attribution:**

```bash
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

**Example:**

```bash
{
  "attribution": {
    "commit": "Generated with AI\n\nCo-Authored-By: AI <[email protected]>",
    "pr": ""
  }
}
```

The `attribution` setting takes precedence over the deprecated `includeCoAuthoredBy` setting. To hide all attribution, set `commit` and `pr` to empty strings.

### [​](#file-suggestion-settings) File suggestion settings

Configure a custom command for `@` file path autocomplete. The built-in file suggestion uses fast filesystem traversal, but large monorepos may benefit from project-specific indexing such as a pre-built file index or custom tooling.

```bash
{
  "fileSuggestion": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/file-suggestion.sh"
  }
}
```

The command runs with the same environment variables as [hooks](/docs/en/hooks), including `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. It receives JSON via stdin with a `query` field:

```bash
{"query": "src/comp"}
```

Output newline-separated file paths to stdout (currently limited to 15):

```bash
src/components/Button.tsx
src/components/Modal.tsx
src/components/Form.tsx
```

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
query=$(cat | jq -r '.query')
your-repo-file-index --query "$query" | head -20
```

### [​](#hook-configuration) Hook configuration

**Managed settings only**: Controls which hooks are allowed to run. This setting can only be configured in [managed settings](#settings-files) and provides administrators with strict control over hook execution.
**Behavior when `allowManagedHooksOnly` is `true`:**

- Managed hooks and SDK hooks are loaded
- User hooks, project hooks, and plugin hooks are blocked

**Configuration:**

```bash
{
  "allowManagedHooksOnly": true
}
```

### [​](#settings-precedence) Settings precedence

Settings apply in order of precedence. From highest to lowest:

1. **Managed settings** (`managed-settings.json`)
   - Policies deployed by IT/DevOps to system directories
   - Cannot be overridden by user or project settings
2. **Command line arguments**
   - Temporary overrides for a specific session
3. **Local project settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
   - Personal project-specific settings
4. **Shared project settings** (`.claude/settings.json`)
   - Team-shared project settings in source control
5. **User settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
   - Personal global settings

This hierarchy ensures that organizational policies are always enforced while still allowing teams and individuals to customize their experience.
For example, if your user settings allow `Bash(npm run:*)` but a project’s shared settings deny it, the project setting takes precedence and the command is blocked.

### [​](#key-points-about-the-configuration-system) Key points about the configuration system

- **Memory files (`CLAUDE.md`)**: Contain instructions and context that Claude loads at startup
- **Settings files (JSON)**: Configure permissions, environment variables, and tool behavior
- **Slash commands**: Custom commands that can be invoked during a session with `/command-name`
- **MCP servers**: Extend Claude Code with additional tools and integrations
- **Precedence**: Higher-level configurations (Managed) override lower-level ones (User/Project)
- **Inheritance**: Settings are merged, with more specific settings adding to or overriding broader ones

### [​](#system-prompt) System prompt

Claude Code’s internal system prompt is not published. To add custom instructions, use `CLAUDE.md` files or the `--append-system-prompt` flag.

### [​](#excluding-sensitive-files) Excluding sensitive files

To prevent Claude Code from accessing files containing sensitive information like API keys, secrets, and environment files, use the `permissions.deny` setting in your `.claude/settings.json` file:

```bash
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)",
      "Read(./secrets/**)",
      "Read(./config/credentials.json)",
      "Read(./build)"
    ]
  }
}
```

This replaces the deprecated `ignorePatterns` configuration. Files matching these patterns will be completely invisible to Claude Code, preventing any accidental exposure of sensitive data.

## [​](#subagent-configuration) Subagent configuration

Claude Code supports custom AI subagents that can be configured at both user and project levels. These subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

- **User subagents**: `~/.claude/agents/` - Available across all your projects
- **Project subagents**: `.claude/agents/` - Specific to your project and can be shared with your team

Subagent files define specialized AI assistants with custom prompts and tool permissions. Learn more about creating and using subagents in the [subagents documentation](/docs/en/sub-agents).

## [​](#plugin-configuration) Plugin configuration

Claude Code supports a plugin system that lets you extend functionality with custom commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers. Plugins are distributed through marketplaces and can be configured at both user and repository levels.

### [​](#plugin-settings) Plugin settings

Plugin-related settings in `settings.json`:

```bash
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "formatter@acme-tools": true,
    "deployer@acme-tools": true,
    "analyzer@security-plugins": false
  },
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/claude-plugins"
    }
  }
}
```

#### [​](#enabledplugins) `enabledPlugins`

Controls which plugins are enabled. Format: `"plugin-name@marketplace-name": true/false`
**Scopes**:

- **User settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`): Personal plugin preferences
- **Project settings** (`.claude/settings.json`): Project-specific plugins shared with team
- **Local settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`): Per-machine overrides (not committed)

**Example**:

```bash
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "code-formatter@team-tools": true,
    "deployment-tools@team-tools": true,
    "experimental-features@personal": false
  }
}
```

#### [​](#extraknownmarketplaces) `extraKnownMarketplaces`

Defines additional marketplaces that should be made available for the repository. Typically used in repository-level settings to ensure team members have access to required plugin sources.
**When a repository includes `extraKnownMarketplaces`**:

1. Team members are prompted to install the marketplace when they trust the folder
2. Team members are then prompted to install plugins from that marketplace
3. Users can skip unwanted marketplaces or plugins (stored in user settings)
4. Installation respects trust boundaries and requires explicit consent

**Example**:

```bash
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "acme-corp/claude-plugins"
      }
    },
    "security-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "git",
        "url": "https://git.example.com/security/plugins.git"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Marketplace source types**:

- `github`: GitHub repository (uses `repo`)
- `git`: Any git URL (uses `url`)
- `directory`: Local filesystem path (uses `path`, for development only)

#### [​](#strictknownmarketplaces) `strictKnownMarketplaces`

**Managed settings only**: Controls which plugin marketplaces users are allowed to add. This setting can only be configured in [`managed-settings.json`](/docs/en/iam#managed-settings) and provides administrators with strict control over marketplace sources.
**Managed settings file locations**:

- **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
- **Linux and WSL**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`
- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`

**Key characteristics**:

- Only available in managed settings (`managed-settings.json`)
- Cannot be overridden by user or project settings (highest precedence)
- Enforced BEFORE network/filesystem operations (blocked sources never execute)
- Uses exact matching for source specifications (including `ref`, `path` for git sources)

**Allowlist behavior**:

- `undefined` (default): No restrictions - users can add any marketplace
- Empty array `[]`: Complete lockdown - users cannot add any new marketplaces
- List of sources: Users can only add marketplaces that match exactly

**All supported source types**:
The allowlist supports six marketplace source types. Each source must match exactly for a user’s marketplace addition to be allowed.

1. **GitHub repositories**:

```bash
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/security-tools", "ref": "v2.0" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "ref": "main", "path": "marketplace" }
```

Fields: `repo` (required), `ref` (optional: branch/tag/SHA), `path` (optional: subdirectory)

2. **Git repositories**:

```bash
{ "source": "git", "url": "https://gitlab.example.com/tools/plugins.git" }
{ "source": "git", "url": "https://bitbucket.org/acme-corp/plugins.git", "ref": "production" }
{ "source": "git", "url": "ssh://[email protected]/plugins.git", "ref": "v3.1", "path": "approved" }
```

Fields: `url` (required), `ref` (optional: branch/tag/SHA), `path` (optional: subdirectory)

3. **URL-based marketplaces**:

```bash
{ "source": "url", "url": "https://plugins.example.com/marketplace.json" }
{ "source": "url", "url": "https://cdn.example.com/marketplace.json", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${TOKEN}" } }
```

Fields: `url` (required), `headers` (optional: HTTP headers for authenticated access)

URL-based marketplaces only download the `marketplace.json` file. They do not download plugin files from the server. Plugins in URL-based marketplaces must use external sources (GitHub, npm, or git URLs) rather than relative paths. For plugins with relative paths, use a Git-based marketplace instead. See [Troubleshooting](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#plugins-with-relative-paths-fail-in-url-based-marketplaces) for details.

4. **NPM packages**:

```bash
{ "source": "npm", "package": "@acme-corp/claude-plugins" }
{ "source": "npm", "package": "@acme-corp/approved-marketplace" }
```

Fields: `package` (required, supports scoped packages)

5. **File paths**:

```bash
{ "source": "file", "path": "/usr/local/share/claude/acme-marketplace.json" }
{ "source": "file", "path": "/opt/acme-corp/plugins/marketplace.json" }
```

Fields: `path` (required: absolute path to marketplace.json file)

6. **Directory paths**:

```bash
{ "source": "directory", "path": "/usr/local/share/claude/acme-plugins" }
{ "source": "directory", "path": "/opt/acme-corp/approved-marketplaces" }
```

Fields: `path` (required: absolute path to directory containing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)
**Configuration examples**:
Example - Allow specific marketplaces only:

```bash
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins"
    },
    {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/security-tools",
      "ref": "v2.0"
    },
    {
      "source": "url",
      "url": "https://plugins.example.com/marketplace.json"
    },
    {
      "source": "npm",
      "package": "@acme-corp/compliance-plugins"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example - Disable all marketplace additions:

```bash
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": []
}
```

**Exact matching requirements**:
Marketplace sources must match **exactly** for a user’s addition to be allowed. For git-based sources (`github` and `git`), this includes all optional fields:

- The `repo` or `url` must match exactly
- The `ref` field must match exactly (or both be undefined)
- The `path` field must match exactly (or both be undefined)

Examples of sources that **do NOT match**:

```bash
// These are DIFFERENT sources:
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "ref": "main" }

// These are also DIFFERENT:
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "path": "marketplace" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
```

**Comparison with `extraKnownMarketplaces`**:

| Aspect | `strictKnownMarketplaces` | `extraKnownMarketplaces` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Organizational policy enforcement | Team convenience |
| **Settings file** | `managed-settings.json` only | Any settings file |
| **Behavior** | Blocks non-allowlisted additions | Auto-installs missing marketplaces |
| **When enforced** | Before network/filesystem operations | After user trust prompt |
| **Can be overridden** | No (highest precedence) | Yes (by higher precedence settings) |
| **Source format** | Direct source object | Named marketplace with nested source |
| **Use case** | Compliance, security restrictions | Onboarding, standardization |

**Format difference**:
`strictKnownMarketplaces` uses direct source objects:

```bash
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
  ]
}
```

`extraKnownMarketplaces` requires named marketplaces:

```bash
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important notes**:

- Restrictions are checked BEFORE any network requests or filesystem operations
- When blocked, users see clear error messages indicating the source is blocked by managed policy
- The restriction applies only to adding NEW marketplaces; previously installed marketplaces remain accessible
- Managed settings have the highest precedence and cannot be overridden

See [Managed marketplace restrictions](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions) for user-facing documentation.

### [​](#managing-plugins) Managing plugins

Use the `/plugin` command to manage plugins interactively:

- Browse available plugins from marketplaces
- Install/uninstall plugins
- Enable/disable plugins
- View plugin details (commands, agents, hooks provided)
- Add/remove marketplaces

Learn more about the plugin system in the [plugins documentation](/docs/en/plugins).

## [​](#environment-variables) Environment variables

Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its behavior:

All environment variables can also be configured in [`settings.json`](#available-settings). This is useful as a way to automatically set environment variables for each session, or to roll out a set of environment variables for your whole team or organization.

| `CLAUDE_CODE_OTEL_HEADERS_HELPER_DEBOUNCE_MS` | Interval for refreshing dynamic OpenTelemetry headers in milliseconds (default: 1740000 / 29 minutes). See [Dynamic headers](/docs/en/monitoring-usage#dynamic-headers) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SHELL` | Override automatic shell detection. Useful when your login shell differs from your preferred working shell (for example, `bash` vs `zsh`) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SHELL_PREFIX` | Command prefix to wrap all bash commands (for example, for logging or auditing). Example: `/path/to/logger.sh` will execute `/path/to/logger.sh <command>` |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH` | Skip AWS authentication for Bedrock (for example, when using an LLM gateway) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_FOUNDRY_AUTH` | Skip Azure authentication for Microsoft Foundry (for example, when using an LLM gateway) |

| `DISABLE_COST_WARNINGS` | Set to `1` to disable cost warning messages |
| `DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING` | Set to `1` to opt out of Sentry error reporting |
| `DISABLE_NON_ESSENTIAL_MODEL_CALLS` | Set to `1` to disable model calls for non-critical paths like flavor text |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for all models (takes precedence over per-model settings) |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_HAIKU` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Haiku models |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_OPUS` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Opus models |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_SONNET` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Sonnet models |
| `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` | Set to `1` to opt out of Statsig telemetry (note that Statsig events do not include user data like code, file paths, or bash commands) |
| `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` | Controls [MCP tool search](/docs/en/mcp#scale-with-mcp-tool-search). Values: `auto` (default, enables at 10% context), `auto:N` (custom threshold, e.g., `auto:5` for 5%), `true` (always on), `false` (disabled) |
| `FORCE_AUTOUPDATE_PLUGINS` | Set to `true` to force plugin auto-updates even when the main auto-updater is disabled via `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` |
| `HTTP_PROXY` | Specify HTTP proxy server for network connections |
| `HTTPS_PROXY` | Specify HTTPS proxy server for network connections |
| `IS_DEMO` | Set to `true` to enable demo mode: hides email and organization from the UI, skips onboarding, and hides internal commands. Useful for streaming or recording sessions |
| `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | Maximum number of tokens allowed in MCP tool responses. Claude Code displays a warning when output exceeds 10,000 tokens (default: 25000) |
| `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` | Override the [extended thinking](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) token budget. Thinking is enabled at max budget (31,999 tokens) by default. Use this to limit the budget (for example, `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=10000`) or disable thinking entirely (`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0`). Extended thinking improves performance on complex reasoning and coding tasks but impacts [prompt caching efficiency](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#caching-with-thinking-blocks). |
| `MCP_TIMEOUT` | Timeout in milliseconds for MCP server startup |
| `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` | Timeout in milliseconds for MCP tool execution |
| `NO_PROXY` | List of domains and IPs to which requests will be directly issued, bypassing proxy |

## [​](#tools-available-to-claude) Tools available to Claude

Claude Code has access to a set of powerful tools that help it understand and modify your codebase:

| Tool | Description | Permission Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AskUserQuestion** | Asks multiple-choice questions to gather requirements or clarify ambiguity | No |
| **Bash** | Executes shell commands in your environment (see [Bash tool behavior](#bash-tool-behavior) below) | Yes |
| **TaskOutput** | Retrieves output from a background task (bash shell or subagent) | No |
| **Edit** | Makes targeted edits to specific files | Yes |
| **ExitPlanMode** | Prompts the user to exit plan mode and start coding | Yes |
| **Glob** | Finds files based on pattern matching | No |
| **Grep** | Searches for patterns in file contents | No |
| **KillShell** | Kills a running background bash shell by its ID | No |
| **MCPSearch** | Searches for and loads MCP tools when [tool search](/docs/en/mcp#scale-with-mcp-tool-search) is enabled | No |
| **NotebookEdit** | Modifies Jupyter notebook cells | Yes |
| **Read** | Reads the contents of files | No |
| **Skill** | Executes a [skill or slash command](/docs/en/slash-commands#skill-tool) within the main conversation | Yes |
| **Task** | Runs a sub-agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks | No |
| **TodoWrite** | Creates and manages structured task lists | No |
| **WebFetch** | Fetches content from a specified URL | Yes |
| **WebSearch** | Performs web searches with domain filtering | Yes |
| **Write** | Creates or overwrites files | Yes |

Permission rules can be configured using `/allowed-tools` or in [permission settings](/docs/en/settings#available-settings). Also see [Tool-specific permission rules](/docs/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules).

### [​](#bash-tool-behavior) Bash tool behavior

The Bash tool executes shell commands with the following persistence behavior:

- **Working directory persists**: When Claude changes the working directory (for example, `cd /path/to/dir`), subsequent Bash commands will execute in that directory. You can use `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1` to reset to the project directory after each command.
- **Environment variables do NOT persist**: Environment variables set in one Bash command (for example, `export MY_VAR=value`) are **not** available in subsequent Bash commands. Each Bash command runs in a fresh shell environment.

To make environment variables available in Bash commands, you have **three options**:
**Option 1: Activate environment before starting Claude Code** (simplest approach)
Activate your virtual environment in your terminal before launching Claude Code:

```bash
conda activate myenv
# or: source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
claude
```

This works for shell environments but environment variables set within Claude’s Bash commands will not persist between commands.
**Option 2: Set CLAUDE\_ENV\_FILE before starting Claude Code** (persistent environment setup)
Export the path to a shell script containing your environment setup:

```bash
export CLAUDE_ENV_FILE=/path/to/env-setup.sh
claude
```

Where `/path/to/env-setup.sh` contains:

```bash
conda activate myenv
# or: source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
# or: export MY_VAR=value
```

Claude Code will source this file before each Bash command, making the environment persistent across all commands.
**Option 3: Use a SessionStart hook** (project-specific configuration)
Configure in `.claude/settings.json`:

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "matcher": "startup",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo 'conda activate myenv' >> \"$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE\""
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

The hook writes to `$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`, which is then sourced before each Bash command. This is ideal for team-shared project configurations.
See [SessionStart hooks](/docs/en/hooks#persisting-environment-variables) for more details on Option 3.

### [​](#extending-tools-with-hooks) Extending tools with hooks

You can run custom commands before or after any tool executes using
[Claude Code hooks](/docs/en/hooks-guide).
For example, you could automatically run a Python formatter after Claude
modifies Python files, or prevent modifications to production configuration
files by blocking Write operations to certain paths.

```

Native installations automatically update in the background to keep you on the latest version.

```bash
brew install --cask claude-code
```

Homebrew installations do not auto-update. Run `brew upgrade claude-code` periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.

```bash
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

WinGet installations do not auto-update. Run `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.

After the installation process completes, navigate to your project and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd your-awesome-project
claude
```

If you encounter any issues during installation, consult the [troubleshooting guide](/docs/en/troubleshooting).

Run `claude doctor` after installation to check your installation type and version.

**Alpine Linux and other musl/uClibc-based distributions**: The native installer requires `libgcc`, `libstdc++`, and `ripgrep`. For Alpine: `apk add libgcc libstdc++ ripgrep`. Set `USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0`.

  ```

## [​](#update-claude-code) Update Claude Code

### [​](#auto-updates) Auto updates

Claude Code automatically keeps itself up to date to ensure you have the latest features and security fixes.

- **Update checks**: Performed on startup and periodically while running
- **Update process**: Downloads and installs automatically in the background
- **Notifications**: You’ll see a notification when updates are installed
- **Applying updates**: Updates take effect the next time you start Claude Code

Homebrew and WinGet installations do not auto-update. Use `brew upgrade claude-code` or `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` to update manually.**Known issue:** Claude Code may notify you of updates before the new version is available in these package managers. If an upgrade fails, wait and try again later.

### [​](#configure-release-channel) Configure release channel

Configure which release channel Claude Code follows for both auto-updates and `claude update` with the `autoUpdatesChannel` setting:

- `"latest"` (default): Receive new features as soon as they’re released
- `"stable"`: Use a version that is typically about one week old, skipping releases with major regressions

Configure this via `/config` → **Auto-update channel**, or add it to your [settings.json file](/docs/en/settings):

```bash
{
  "autoUpdatesChannel": "stable"
}
```

For enterprise deployments, you can enforce a consistent release channel across your organization using [managed settings](/docs/en/iam#managed-settings).

### [​](#disable-auto-updates) Disable auto-updates

title: Agent Skills
---

A Skill is a markdown file that teaches Claude how to do something specific, such as reviewing PRs using your team’s standards or generating commit messages in your preferred format. When you ask Claude something that matches a Skill’s purpose, Claude automatically applies it.
Skills can also bundle scripts in any language. This means Claude can run Python, Node.js, Bash, or any other scripts you include, giving it capabilities far beyond what’s possible in a single prompt. For example, generate interactive visualizations, query databases, process files, call APIs, or produce reports in any format. See [Generate visual output](#generate-visual-output) for an example Skill that uses a Python script to create an interactive codebase visualization.
This guide covers creating Skills, configuring them with metadata and scripts, and sharing them with your team or organization.

## [​](#create-your-first-skill) Create your first Skill

This example creates a personal Skill that teaches Claude to explain code using visual diagrams and analogies. Unlike Claude’s default explanations, this Skill ensures every explanation includes an ASCII diagram and a real-world analogy.

1

Check available Skills

Before creating a Skill, see what Skills Claude already has access to:

```bash
What Skills are available?
```

Claude will list any Skills currently loaded. You may see none, or you may see Skills from plugins or your organization.

2

Create the Skill directory

Create a directory for the Skill in your personal Skills folder. Personal Skills are available across all your projects. (You can also create [project Skills](#where-skills-live) in `.claude/skills/` to share with your team.)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/explaining-code
```

3

Write SKILL.md

Every Skill needs a `SKILL.md` file. The file starts with YAML metadata between `---` markers and must include a `name` and `description`, followed by Markdown instructions that Claude follows when the Skill is active.The `description` is especially important, because Claude uses it to decide when to apply the Skill.Create `~/.claude/skills/explaining-code/SKILL.md`:

```bash
---
name: explaining-code
description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks "how does this work?"
---

When explaining code, always include:

1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life
2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships
3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens
4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?

Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.
```

4

Load and verify the Skill

Skills are automatically loaded when created or modified. Verify the Skill appears in the list:

```bash
What Skills are available?
```

You should see `explaining-code` in the list with its description.

5

Test the Skill

Open any file in your project and ask Claude a question that matches the Skill’s description:

```bash
How does this code work?
```

Claude should ask to use the `explaining-code` Skill, then include an analogy and ASCII diagram in its explanation. If the Skill doesn’t trigger, try rephrasing to include more keywords from the description, like “explain how this works.”

The rest of this guide covers how Skills work, configuration options, and troubleshooting.

## [​](#how-skills-work) How Skills work

Skills are **model-invoked**: Claude decides which Skills to use based on your request. You don’t need to explicitly call a Skill. Claude automatically applies relevant Skills when your request matches their description.
When you send a request, Claude follows these steps to find and use relevant Skills:

1

Discovery

At startup, Claude loads only the name and description of each available Skill. This keeps startup fast while giving Claude enough context to know when each Skill might be relevant.

2

Activation

When your request matches a Skill’s description, Claude asks to use the Skill. You’ll see a confirmation prompt before the full `SKILL.md` is loaded into context. Since Claude reads these descriptions to find relevant Skills, [write descriptions](#skill-not-triggering) that include keywords users would naturally say.

3

Execution

Claude follows the Skill’s instructions, loading referenced files or running bundled scripts as needed.

### [​](#where-skills-live) Where Skills live

Where you store a Skill determines who can use it:

| Location | Path | Applies to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise | See [managed settings](/docs/en/iam#managed-settings) | All users in your organization |
| Personal | `~/.claude/skills/` | You, across all projects |
| Project | `.claude/skills/` | Anyone working in this repository |
| Plugin | Bundled with [plugins](/docs/en/plugins) | Anyone with the plugin installed |

If two Skills have the same name, the higher row wins: managed overrides personal, personal overrides project, and project overrides plugin.

#### [​](#automatic-discovery-from-nested-directories) Automatic discovery from nested directories

When you work with files in subdirectories, Claude Code automatically discovers Skills from nested `.claude/skills/` directories. For example, if you’re editing a file in `packages/frontend/`, Claude Code also looks for Skills in `packages/frontend/.claude/skills/`. This supports monorepo setups where packages have their own Skills.

### [​](#when-to-use-skills-versus-other-options) When to use Skills versus other options

Claude Code offers several ways to customize behavior. The key difference: **Skills are triggered automatically by Claude** based on your request, while slash commands require you to type `/command` explicitly.

| Use this | When you want to… | When it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Skills** | Give Claude specialized knowledge (e.g., “review PRs using our standards”) | Claude chooses when relevant |
| **[Slash commands](/docs/en/slash-commands)** | Create reusable prompts (e.g., `/deploy staging`) | You type `/command` to run it |
| **[CLAUDE.md](/docs/en/memory)** | Set project-wide instructions (e.g., “use TypeScript strict mode”) | Loaded into every conversation |
| **[Subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents)** | Delegate tasks to a separate context with its own tools | Claude delegates, or you invoke explicitly |
| **[Hooks](/docs/en/hooks)** | Run scripts on events (e.g., lint on file save) | Fires on specific tool events |
| **[MCP servers](/docs/en/mcp)** | Connect Claude to external tools and data sources | Claude calls MCP tools as needed |

**Skills vs. subagents**: Skills add knowledge to the current conversation. Subagents run in a separate context with their own tools. Use Skills for guidance and standards; use subagents when you need isolation or different tool access.
**Skills vs. MCP**: Skills tell Claude *how* to use tools; MCP *provides* the tools. For example, an MCP server connects Claude to your database, while a Skill teaches Claude your data model and query patterns.

For a deep dive into the architecture and real-world applications of Agent Skills, read [Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills).

## [​](#configure-skills) Configure Skills

This section covers Skill file structure, supporting files, tool restrictions, and distribution options.

### [​](#write-skill-md) Write SKILL.md

The `SKILL.md` file is the only required file in a Skill. It has two parts: YAML metadata (the section between `---` markers) at the top, and Markdown instructions that tell Claude how to use the Skill:

```bash
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it
---

# Your Skill Name

## Instructions
Provide clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude.

## Examples
Show concrete examples of using this Skill.
```

#### [​](#available-metadata-fields) Available metadata fields

You can use the following fields in the YAML frontmatter:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Yes | Skill name. Must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters). Should match the directory name. |
| `description` | Yes | What the Skill does and when to use it (max 1024 characters). Claude uses this to decide when to apply the Skill. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Tools Claude can use without asking permission when this Skill is active. Supports comma-separated values or YAML-style lists. See [Restrict tool access](#restrict-tool-access-with-allowed-tools). |
| `model` | No | [Model](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview) to use when this Skill is active (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`). Defaults to the conversation’s model. |
| `context` | No | Set to `fork` to run the Skill in a forked sub-agent context with its own conversation history. |
| `agent` | No | Specify which [agent type](/docs/en/sub-agents#built-in-subagents) to use when `context: fork` is set (e.g., `Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`, or a custom agent name from `.claude/agents/`). Defaults to `general-purpose` if not specified. Only applicable when combined with `context: fork`. |
| `hooks` | No | Define hooks scoped to this Skill’s lifecycle. Supports `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and `Stop` events. |
| `user-invocable` | No | Controls whether the Skill appears in the slash command menu. Does not affect the [`Skill` tool](/docs/en/slash-commands#skill-tool) or automatic discovery. Defaults to `true`. See [Control Skill visibility](#control-skill-visibility). |

#### [​](#available-string-substitutions) Available string substitutions

Skills support string substitution for dynamic values in the Skill content:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$ARGUMENTS` | All arguments passed when invoking the Skill. If `$ARGUMENTS` is not present in the content, arguments are appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>`. |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | The current session ID. Useful for logging, creating session-specific files, or correlating Skill output with sessions. |

**Example using substitutions:**

```bash
---
name: session-logger
description: Log activity for this session
---

Log the following to logs/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.log:

$ARGUMENTS
```

See the [best practices guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) for complete authoring guidance including validation rules.

### [​](#update-or-delete-a-skill) Update or delete a Skill

To update a Skill, edit its `SKILL.md` file directly. To remove a Skill, delete its directory. Changes take effect immediately.

### [​](#add-supporting-files-with-progressive-disclosure) Add supporting files with progressive disclosure

Skills share Claude’s context window with conversation history, other Skills, and your request. To keep context focused, use **progressive disclosure**: put essential information in `SKILL.md` and detailed reference material in separate files that Claude reads only when needed.
This approach lets you bundle comprehensive documentation, examples, and scripts without consuming context upfront. Claude loads additional files only when the task requires them.

Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines for optimal performance. If your content exceeds this, split detailed reference material into separate files.

#### [​](#example:-multi-file-skill-structure) Example: multi-file Skill structure

Claude discovers supporting files through links in your `SKILL.md`. The following example shows a Skill with detailed documentation in separate files and utility scripts that Claude can execute without reading:

```bash
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md (required - overview and navigation)
├── reference.md (detailed API docs - loaded when needed)
├── examples.md (usage examples - loaded when needed)
└── scripts/
    └── helper.py (utility script - executed, not loaded)
```

The `SKILL.md` file references these supporting files so Claude knows they exist:

```bash
## Overview

[Essential instructions here]

## Additional resources

- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)
- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)

## Utility scripts

To validate input files, run the helper script. It checks for required fields and returns any validation errors:
```bash
python scripts/helper.py input.txt
```
```

Keep references one level deep. Link directly from `SKILL.md` to reference files. Deeply nested references (file A links to file B which links to file C) may result in Claude partially reading files.

**Bundle utility scripts for zero-context execution.** Scripts in your Skill directory can be executed without loading their contents into context. Claude runs the script and only the output consumes tokens. This is useful for:

- Complex validation logic that would be verbose to describe in prose
- Data processing that’s more reliable as tested code than generated code
- Operations that benefit from consistency across uses

In `SKILL.md`, tell Claude to run the script rather than read it:

```bash
Run the validation script to check the form:
python scripts/validate_form.py input.pdf
```

For complete guidance on structuring Skills, see the [best practices guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices#progressive-disclosure-patterns).

### [​](#restrict-tool-access-with-allowed-tools) Restrict tool access with allowed-tools

Use the `allowed-tools` frontmatter field to limit which tools Claude can use when a Skill is active. You can specify tools as a comma-separated string or a YAML list:

```bash
---
name: reading-files-safely
description: Read files without making changes. Use when you need read-only file access.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
```

Or use YAML-style lists for better readability:

```bash
---
name: reading-files-safely
description: Read files without making changes. Use when you need read-only file access.
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
---
```

When this Skill is active, Claude can only use the specified tools (Read, Grep, Glob) without needing to ask for permission. This is useful for:

- Read-only Skills that shouldn’t modify files
- Skills with limited scope: for example, only data analysis, no file writing
- Security-sensitive workflows where you want to restrict capabilities

If `allowed-tools` is omitted, the Skill doesn’t restrict tools. Claude uses its standard permission model and may ask you to approve tool usage.

`allowed-tools` is only supported for Skills in Claude Code.

### [​](#run-skills-in-a-forked-context) Run Skills in a forked context

Use `context: fork` to run a Skill in an isolated sub-agent context with its own conversation history. This is useful for Skills that perform complex multi-step operations without cluttering the main conversation:

```bash
---
name: code-analysis
description: Analyze code quality and generate detailed reports
context: fork
---
```

### [​](#define-hooks-for-skills) Define hooks for Skills

Skills can define hooks that run during the Skill’s lifecycle. Use the `hooks` field to specify `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, or `Stop` handlers:

```bash
---
name: secure-operations
description: Perform operations with additional security checks
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/security-check.sh $TOOL_INPUT"
          once: true
---
```

The `once: true` option runs the hook only once per session. After the first successful execution, the hook is removed.
Hooks defined in a Skill are scoped to that Skill’s execution and are automatically cleaned up when the Skill finishes.
See [Hooks](/docs/en/hooks) for the complete hook configuration format.

### [​](#control-skill-visibility) Control Skill visibility

Skills can be invoked in three ways:

1. **Manual invocation**: You type `/skill-name` in the prompt
2. **Programmatic invocation**: Claude calls it via the [`Skill` tool](/docs/en/slash-commands#skill-tool)
3. **Automatic discovery**: Claude reads the Skill’s description and loads it when relevant to the conversation

The `user-invocable` field controls only manual invocation. When set to `false`, the Skill is hidden from the slash command menu but Claude can still invoke it programmatically or discover it automatically.
To block programmatic invocation via the `Skill` tool, use `disable-model-invocation: true` instead.

#### [​](#when-to-use-each-setting) When to use each setting

| Setting | Slash menu | `Skill` tool | Auto-discovery | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `user-invocable: true` (default) | Visible | Allowed | Yes | Skills you want users to invoke directly |
| `user-invocable: false` | Hidden | Allowed | Yes | Skills that Claude can use but users shouldn’t invoke manually |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Visible | Blocked | Yes | Skills you want users to invoke but not Claude programmatically |

#### [​](#example:-model-only-skill) Example: model-only Skill

Set `user-invocable: false` to hide a Skill from the slash menu while still allowing Claude to invoke it programmatically:

```bash
---
name: internal-review-standards
description: Apply internal code review standards when reviewing pull requests
user-invocable: false
---
```

With this setting, users won’t see the Skill in the `/` menu, but Claude can still invoke it via the `Skill` tool or discover it automatically based on context.

### [​](#skills-and-subagents) Skills and subagents

There are two ways Skills and subagents can work together:

#### [​](#give-a-subagent-access-to-skills) Give a subagent access to Skills

[Subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents) do not automatically inherit Skills from the main conversation. To give a custom subagent access to specific Skills, list them in the subagent’s `skills` field:

```bash
# .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Review code for quality and best practices
skills: pr-review, security-check
---
```

The full content of each listed Skill is injected into the subagent’s context at startup, not just made available for invocation. If the `skills` field is omitted, no Skills are loaded for that subagent.

Built-in agents (Explore, Plan, general-purpose) do not have access to your Skills. Only custom subagents you define in `.claude/agents/` with an explicit `skills` field can use Skills.

#### [​](#run-a-skill-in-a-subagent-context) Run a Skill in a subagent context

Use `context: fork` and `agent` to run a Skill in a forked subagent with its own separate context. See [Run Skills in a forked context](#run-skills-in-a-forked-context) for details.

### [​](#distribute-skills) Distribute Skills

You can share Skills in several ways:

- **Project Skills**: Commit `.claude/skills/` to version control. Anyone who clones the repository gets the Skills.
- **Plugins**: To share Skills across multiple repositories, create a `skills/` directory in your [plugin](/docs/en/plugins) with Skill folders containing `SKILL.md` files. Distribute through a [plugin marketplace](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).
- **Managed**: Administrators can deploy Skills organization-wide through [managed settings](/docs/en/iam#managed-settings). See [Where Skills live](#where-skills-live) for managed Skill paths.

## [​](#examples) Examples

These examples show common Skill patterns, from minimal single-file Skills to multi-file Skills with supporting documentation and scripts.

### [​](#simple-skill-single-file) Simple Skill (single file)

A minimal Skill needs only a `SKILL.md` file with frontmatter and instructions. This example helps Claude generate commit messages by examining staged changes:

```bash
commit-helper/
└── SKILL.md
```

```bash
---
name: generating-commit-messages
description: Generates clear commit messages from git diffs. Use when writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
---

# Generating Commit Messages

## Instructions

1. Run `git diff --staged` to see changes
2. I'll suggest a commit message with:
   - Summary under 50 characters
   - Detailed description
   - Affected components

## Best practices

- Use present tense
- Explain what and why, not how
```

### [​](#use-multiple-files) Use multiple files

For complex Skills, use progressive disclosure to keep the main `SKILL.md` focused while providing detailed documentation in supporting files. This PDF processing Skill includes reference docs, utility scripts, and uses `allowed-tools` to restrict Claude to specific tools:

```bash
pdf-processing/
├── SKILL.md              # Overview and quick start
├── FORMS.md              # Form field mappings and filling instructions
├── REFERENCE.md          # API details for pypdf and pdfplumber
└── scripts/
    ├── fill_form.py      # Utility to populate form fields
    └── validate.py       # Checks PDFs for required fields
```

**`SKILL.md`**:

```bash
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text, fill forms, merge PDFs. Use when working with PDF files, forms, or document extraction. Requires pypdf and pdfplumber packages.
allowed-tools: Read, Bash(python:*)
---

# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text:
```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("doc.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

For form filling, see [FORMS.md](FORMS.md).
For detailed API reference, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Requirements

Packages must be installed in your environment:
```bash
pip install pypdf pdfplumber
```
```

If your Skill requires external packages, list them in the description. Packages must be installed in your environment before Claude can use them.

### [​](#generate-visual-output) Generate visual output

Skills can bundle and run scripts in any language, giving Claude capabilities beyond what’s possible in a single prompt. One powerful pattern is generating visual output: interactive HTML files that open in your browser for exploring data, debugging, or creating reports.
This example creates a codebase explorer: an interactive tree view where you can expand and collapse directories, see file sizes at a glance, and identify file types by color.
Create the Skill directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts
```

Create `~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/SKILL.md`. The description tells Claude when to activate this Skill, and the instructions tell Claude to run the bundled script:

```bash
---
name: codebase-visualizer
description: Generate an interactive collapsible tree visualization of your codebase. Use when exploring a new repo, understanding project structure, or identifying large files.
allowed-tools: Bash(python:*)
---

# Codebase Visualizer

Generate an interactive HTML tree view that shows your project's file structure with collapsible directories.

## Usage

Run the visualization script from your project root:

```bash
python ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts/visualize.py .
```

This creates `codebase-map.html` in the current directory and opens it in your default browser.

## What the visualization shows

- **Collapsible directories**: Click folders to expand/collapse
- **File sizes**: Displayed next to each file
- **Colors**: Different colors for different file types
- **Directory totals**: Shows aggregate size of each folder
```

Create `~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts/visualize.py`. This script scans a directory tree and generates a self-contained HTML file with:

- A **summary sidebar** showing file count, directory count, total size, and number of file types
- A **bar chart** breaking down the codebase by file type (top 8 by size)
- A **collapsible tree** where you can expand and collapse directories, with color-coded file type indicators

The script requires Python but uses only built-in libraries, so there are no packages to install:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Generate an interactive collapsible tree visualization of a codebase."""

import json
import sys
import webbrowser
from pathlib import Path
from collections import Counter

IGNORE = {'.git', 'node_modules', '__pycache__', '.venv', 'venv', 'dist', 'build'}

                continue
            if item.is_file():
                size = item.stat().st_size
                ext = item.suffix.lower() or '(no ext)'
                result["children"].append({"name": item.name, "size": size, "ext": ext})
                result["size"] += size
                stats["files"] += 1
                stats["extensions"][ext] += 1

                stats["dirs"] += 1
                child = scan(item, stats)
                if child["children"]:
                    result["children"].append(child)
                    result["size"] += child["size"]

To test, open Claude Code in any project and ask “Visualize this codebase.” Claude runs the script, generates `codebase-map.html`, and opens it in your browser.
This pattern works for any visual output: dependency graphs, test coverage reports, API documentation, or database schema visualizations. The bundled script does the heavy lifting while Claude handles orchestration.

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

### [​](#view-and-test-skills) View and test Skills

To see which Skills Claude has access to, ask Claude a question like “What Skills are available?” Claude loads all available Skill names and descriptions into the context window when a conversation starts, so it can list the Skills it currently has access to.
To test a specific Skill, ask Claude to do a task that matches the Skill’s description. For example, if your Skill has the description “Reviews pull requests for code quality”, ask Claude to “Review the changes in my current branch.” Claude automatically uses the Skill when the request matches its description.

### [​](#skill-not-triggering) Skill not triggering

The description field is how Claude decides whether to use your Skill. Vague descriptions like “Helps with documents” don’t give Claude enough information to match your Skill to relevant requests.
A good description answers two questions:

1. **What does this Skill do?** List the specific capabilities.
2. **When should Claude use it?** Include trigger terms users would mention.

```bash
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

This description works because it names specific actions (extract, fill, merge) and includes keywords users would say (PDF, forms, document extraction).

### [​](#skill-doesn’t-load) Skill doesn’t load

**Check the file path.** Skills must be in the correct directory with the exact filename `SKILL.md` (case-sensitive):

| Type | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Personal | `~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` |
| Project | `.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` |
| Enterprise | See [Where Skills live](#where-skills-live) for platform-specific paths |
| Plugin | `skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` inside the plugin directory |

**Check the YAML syntax.** Invalid YAML in the frontmatter prevents the Skill from loading. The frontmatter must start with `---` on line 1 (no blank lines before it), end with `---` before the Markdown content, and use spaces for indentation (not tabs).
**Run debug mode.** Use `claude --debug` to see Skill loading errors.

### [​](#skill-has-errors) Skill has errors

**Check dependencies are installed.** If your Skill uses external packages, they must be installed in your environment before Claude can use them.
**Check script permissions.** Scripts need execute permissions: `chmod +x scripts/*.py`
**Check file paths.** Use forward slashes (Unix style) in all paths. Use `scripts/helper.py`, not `scripts\helper.py`.

### [​](#multiple-skills-conflict) Multiple Skills conflict

If Claude uses the wrong Skill or seems confused between similar Skills, the descriptions are probably too similar. Make each description distinct by using specific trigger terms.
For example, instead of two Skills with “data analysis” in both descriptions, differentiate them: one for “sales data in Excel files and CRM exports” and another for “log files and system metrics”. The more specific your trigger terms, the easier it is for Claude to match the right Skill to your request.

### [​](#plugin-skills-not-appearing) Plugin Skills not appearing

**Symptom**: You installed a plugin from a marketplace, but its Skills don’t appear when you ask Claude “What Skills are available?”
**Solution**: Clear the plugin cache and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache
```

Then restart Claude Code and reinstall the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

This forces Claude Code to re-download and re-register the plugin’s Skills.
**If Skills still don’t appear**, verify the plugin’s directory structure is correct. Skills must be in a `skills/` directory at the plugin root:

```bash
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
└── skills/
    └── my-skill/
        └── SKILL.md
```

title: Claude Code in Slack
---

Claude Code in Slack brings the power of Claude Code directly into your Slack workspace. When you mention `@Claude` with a coding task, Claude automatically detects the intent and creates a Claude Code session on the web, allowing you to delegate development work without leaving your team conversations.
This integration is built on the existing Claude for Slack app but adds intelligent routing to Claude Code on the web for coding-related requests.

## [​](#use-cases) Use cases

- **Bug investigation and fixes**: Ask Claude to investigate and fix bugs as soon as they’re reported in Slack channels.
- **Quick code reviews and modifications**: Have Claude implement small features or refactor code based on team feedback.
- **Collaborative debugging**: When team discussions provide crucial context (e.g., error reproductions or user reports), Claude can use that information to inform its debugging approach.
- **Parallel task execution**: Kick off coding tasks in Slack while you continue other work, receiving notifications when complete.

## [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

Before using Claude Code in Slack, ensure you have the following:

| Requirement | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Plan | Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise with Claude Code access (premium seats) |
| Claude Code on the web | Access to [Claude Code on the web](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) must be enabled |
| GitHub Account | Connected to Claude Code on the web with at least one repository authenticated |
| Slack Authentication | Your Slack account linked to your Claude account via the Claude app |

## [​](#setting-up-claude-code-in-slack) Setting up Claude Code in Slack

1

Install the Claude App in Slack

A workspace administrator must install the Claude app from the Slack App Marketplace. Visit the [Slack App Marketplace](https://slack.com/marketplace/A08SF47R6P4) and click “Add to Slack” to begin the installation process.

2

Connect your Claude account

After the app is installed, authenticate your individual Claude account:

1. Open the Claude app in Slack by clicking on “Claude” in your Apps section
2. Navigate to the App Home tab
3. Click “Connect” to link your Slack account with your Claude account
4. Complete the authentication flow in your browser

3

Configure Claude Code on the web

Ensure your Claude Code on the web is properly configured:

- Visit [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) and sign in with the same account you connected to Slack
- Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
- Authenticate at least one repository that you want Claude to work with

4

Choose your routing mode

After connecting your accounts, configure how Claude handles your messages in Slack. Navigate to the Claude App Home in Slack to find the **Routing Mode** setting.

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Code only** | Claude routes all @mentions to Claude Code sessions. Best for teams using Claude in Slack exclusively for development tasks. |
| **Code + Chat** | Claude analyzes each message and intelligently routes between Claude Code (for coding tasks) and Claude Chat (for writing, analysis, and general questions). Best for teams who want a single @Claude entry point for all types of work. |

In Code + Chat mode, if Claude routes a message to Chat but you wanted a coding session, you can click “Retry as Code” to create a Claude Code session instead. Similarly, if it’s routed to Code but you wanted a Chat session, you can choose that option in that thread.

## [​](#how-it-works) How it works

### [​](#automatic-detection) Automatic detection

When you mention @Claude in a Slack channel or thread, Claude automatically analyzes your message to determine if it’s a coding task. If Claude detects coding intent, it will route your request to Claude Code on the web instead of responding as a regular chat assistant.
You can also explicitly tell Claude to handle a request as a coding task, even if it doesn’t automatically detect it.

Claude Code in Slack only works in channels (public or private). It does not work in direct messages (DMs).

### [​](#context-gathering) Context gathering

**From threads**: When you @mention Claude in a thread, it gathers context from all messages in that thread to understand the full conversation.
**From channels**: When mentioned directly in a channel, Claude looks at recent channel messages for relevant context.
This context helps Claude understand the problem, select the appropriate repository, and inform its approach to the task.

When @Claude is invoked in Slack, Claude is given access to the conversation context to better understand your request. Claude may follow directions from other messages in the context, so users should make sure to only use Claude in trusted Slack conversations.

### [​](#session-flow) Session flow

1. **Initiation**: You @mention Claude with a coding request
2. **Detection**: Claude analyzes your message and detects coding intent
3. **Session creation**: A new Claude Code session is created on claude.ai/code
4. **Progress updates**: Claude posts status updates to your Slack thread as work progresses
5. **Completion**: When finished, Claude @mentions you with a summary and action buttons
6. **Review**: Click “View Session” to see the full transcript, or “Create PR” to open a pull request

## [​](#user-interface-elements) User interface elements

### [​](#app-home) App Home

The App Home tab shows your connection status and allows you to connect or disconnect your Claude account from Slack.

### [​](#message-actions) Message actions

- **View Session**: Opens the full Claude Code session in your browser where you can see all work performed, continue the session, or make additional requests.
- **Create PR**: Creates a pull request directly from the session’s changes.
- **Retry as Code**: If Claude initially responds as a chat assistant but you wanted a coding session, click this button to retry the request as a Claude Code task.
- **Change Repo**: Allows you to select a different repository if Claude chose incorrectly.

### [​](#repository-selection) Repository selection

Claude automatically selects a repository based on context from your Slack conversation. If multiple repositories could apply, Claude may display a dropdown allowing you to choose the correct one.

## [​](#access-and-permissions) Access and permissions

### [​](#user-level-access) User-level access

| Access Type | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code Sessions | Each user runs sessions under their own Claude account |
| Usage & Rate Limits | Sessions count against the individual user’s plan limits |
| Repository Access | Users can only access repositories they’ve personally connected |
| Session History | Sessions appear in your Claude Code history on claude.ai/code |

### [​](#workspace-admin-permissions) Workspace admin permissions

Slack workspace administrators control whether the Claude app can be installed in the workspace. Individual users then authenticate with their own Claude accounts to use the integration.

## [​](#what’s-accessible-where) What’s accessible where

**In Slack**: You’ll see status updates, completion summaries, and action buttons. The full transcript is preserved and always accessible.
**On the web**: The complete Claude Code session with full conversation history, all code changes, file operations, and the ability to continue the session or create pull requests.

- **Be specific**: Include file names, function names, or error messages when relevant.
- **Provide context**: Mention the repository or project if it’s not clear from the conversation.
- **Define success**: Explain what “done” looks like—should Claude write tests? Update documentation? Create a PR?
- **Use threads**: Reply in threads when discussing bugs or features so Claude can gather the full context.

### [​](#when-to-use-slack-vs-web) When to use Slack vs. web

**Use Slack when**: Context already exists in a Slack discussion, you want to kick off a task asynchronously, or you’re collaborating with teammates who need visibility.
**Use the web directly when**: You need to upload files, want real-time interaction during development, or are working on longer, more complex tasks.

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

### [​](#sessions-not-starting) Sessions not starting

1. Verify your Claude account is connected in the Claude App Home
2. Check that you have Claude Code on the web access enabled
3. Ensure you have at least one GitHub repository connected to Claude Code

### [​](#repository-not-showing) Repository not showing

1. Connect the repository in Claude Code on the web at [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
2. Verify your GitHub permissions for that repository
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your GitHub account

### [​](#wrong-repository-selected) Wrong repository selected

1. Click the “Change Repo” button to select a different repository
2. Include the repository name in your request for more accurate selection

### [​](#authentication-errors) Authentication errors

1. Disconnect and reconnect your Claude account in the App Home
2. Ensure you’re signed into the correct Claude account in your browser
3. Check that your Claude plan includes Claude Code access

### [​](#session-expiration) Session expiration

1. Sessions remain accessible in your Claude Code history on the web
2. You can continue or reference past sessions from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)

## [​](#current-limitations) Current limitations

- **GitHub only**: Currently supports repositories on GitHub.
- **One PR at a time**: Each session can create one pull request.
- **Rate limits apply**: Sessions use your individual Claude plan’s rate limits.
- **Web access required**: Users must have Claude Code on the web access; those without it will only get standard Claude chat responses.

## [​](#custom-slash-commands) Custom slash commands

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.

Slash command autocomplete works anywhere in your input, not just at the beginning. Type `/` at any position to see available commands.

### [​](#syntax) Syntax

```bash
/<command-name> [arguments]
```

#### [​](#parameters) Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<command-name>` | Name derived from the Markdown filename (without `.md` extension) |
| `[arguments]` | Optional arguments passed to the command |

### [​](#command-types) Command types

#### [​](#project-commands) Project commands

Commands stored in your repository and shared with your team. When listed in `/help`, these commands show “(project)” after their description.
**Location**: `.claude/commands/`
The following example creates the `/optimize` command:

```bash
# Create a project command
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

#### [​](#personal-commands) Personal commands

Commands available across all your projects. When listed in `/help`, these commands show “(user)” after their description.
**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`
The following example creates the `/security-review` command:

```bash
# Create a personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

### [​](#features) Features

#### [​](#namespacing) Namespacing

Use subdirectories to group related commands. Subdirectories appear in the command description but don’t affect the command name.
For example:

- `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates `/component` with description “(project:frontend)”
- `~/.claude/commands/component.md` creates `/component` with description “(user)”

If a project command and user command share the same name, the project command takes precedence and the user command is silently ignored. For example, if both `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and `~/.claude/commands/deploy.md` exist, `/deploy` runs the project version.
Commands in different subdirectories can share names since the subdirectory appears in the description to distinguish them. For example, `.claude/commands/frontend/test.md` and `.claude/commands/backend/test.md` both create `/test`, but show as “(project:frontend)” and “(project:backend)” respectively.

#### [​](#arguments) Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using argument placeholders:

##### All arguments with `$ARGUMENTS`

The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder captures all arguments passed to the command:

```bash
# Command definition
echo 'Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards' > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

# Usage
> /fix-issue 123 high-priority
# $ARGUMENTS becomes: "123 high-priority"
```

##### Individual arguments with `$1`, `$2`, etc.

Access specific arguments individually using positional parameters (similar to shell scripts):

```bash
# Command definition
echo 'Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3' > .claude/commands/review-pr.md

# Usage
> /review-pr 456 high alice
# $1 becomes "456", $2 becomes "high", $3 becomes "alice"
```

Use positional arguments when you need to:

- Access arguments individually in different parts of your command
- Provide defaults for missing arguments
- Build more structured commands with specific parameter roles

#### [​](#bash-command-execution) Bash command execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix. The output is included in the command context. You *must* include `allowed-tools` with the `Bash` tool, but you can choose the specific bash commands to allow.
For example:

```bash
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

#### [​](#file-references) File references

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix to [reference files](/docs/en/common-workflows#reference-files-and-directories).
For example:

```bash
# Reference a specific file

Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files

Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

#### [​](#thinking-mode) Thinking mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including [extended thinking keywords](/docs/en/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking).

### [​](#frontmatter) Frontmatter

Command files support frontmatter, useful for specifying metadata about the command:

| Frontmatter | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allowed-tools` | List of tools the command can use | Inherits from the conversation |
| `argument-hint` | The arguments expected for the slash command. Example: `argument-hint: add [tagId] | remove [tagId] | list`. This hint is shown to the user when auto-completing the slash command. | None |
| `context` | Set to `fork` to run the command in a forked sub-agent context with its own conversation history. | Inline (no fork) |
| `agent` | Specify which [agent type](/docs/en/sub-agents#built-in-subagents) to use when `context: fork` is set. Only applicable when combined with `context: fork`. | `general-purpose` |
| `description` | Brief description of the command | Uses the first line from the prompt |
| `model` | Specific model string (see [Models overview](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview)) | Inherits from the conversation |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Whether to prevent the `Skill` tool from calling this command | false |
| `hooks` | Define hooks scoped to this command’s execution. See [Define hooks for commands](#define-hooks-for-commands). | None |

For example:

```bash
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
argument-hint: [message]
description: Create a git commit
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
---

Create a git commit with message: $ARGUMENTS
```

Example using positional arguments:

```bash
---
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
description: Review pull request
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3.
Focus on security, performance, and code style.
```

#### [​](#define-hooks-for-commands) Define hooks for commands

Slash commands can define hooks that run during the command’s execution. Use the `hooks` field to specify `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, or `Stop` handlers:

```bash
---
description: Deploy to staging with validation
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-deploy.sh"
          once: true
---

Deploy the current branch to staging environment.
```

The `once: true` option runs the hook only once per session. After the first successful execution, the hook is removed.
Hooks defined in a command are scoped to that command’s execution and are automatically cleaned up when the command finishes.
See [Hooks](/docs/en/hooks) for the complete hook configuration format.

## [​](#plugin-commands) Plugin commands

[Plugins](/docs/en/plugins) can provide custom slash commands that integrate seamlessly with Claude Code. Plugin commands work exactly like user-defined commands but are distributed through [plugin marketplaces](/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).

### [​](#how-plugin-commands-work) How plugin commands work

Plugin commands are:

- **Namespaced**: Commands can use the format `/plugin-name:command-name` to avoid conflicts (plugin prefix is optional unless there are name collisions)
- **Automatically available**: Once a plugin is installed and enabled, its commands appear in `/help`
- **Fully integrated**: Support all command features (arguments, frontmatter, bash execution, file references)

### [​](#plugin-command-structure) Plugin command structure

**Location**: `commands/` directory in plugin root
**File format**: Markdown files with frontmatter
**Basic command structure**:

```bash
---
description: Brief description of what the command does
---

# Command Name

Detailed instructions for Claude on how to execute this command.
Include specific guidance on parameters, expected outcomes, and any special considerations.
```

**Advanced command features**:

- **Arguments**: Use placeholders like `{arg1}` in command descriptions
- **Subdirectories**: Organize commands in subdirectories for namespacing
- **Bash integration**: Commands can execute shell scripts and programs
- **File references**: Commands can reference and modify project files

### [​](#invocation-patterns) Invocation patterns

Direct command (when no conflicts)

```bash
/command-name
```

Plugin-prefixed (when needed for disambiguation)

```bash
/plugin-name:command-name
```

With arguments (if command supports them)

```bash
/command-name arg1 arg2
```

## [​](#mcp-slash-commands) MCP slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands that become available in Claude Code. These commands are dynamically discovered from connected MCP servers.

### [​](#command-format) Command format

MCP commands follow the pattern:

```bash
/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name> [arguments]
```

### [​](#features-2) Features

#### [​](#dynamic-discovery) Dynamic discovery

MCP commands are automatically available when:

- An MCP server is connected and active
- The server exposes prompts through the MCP protocol
- The prompts are successfully retrieved during connection

#### [​](#arguments-2) Arguments

MCP prompts can accept arguments defined by the server:

```bash
# Without arguments
> /mcp__github__list_prs

# With arguments
> /mcp__github__pr_review 456
> /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug title" high
```

#### [​](#naming-conventions) Naming conventions

Server and prompt names are normalized:

- Spaces and special characters become underscores
- Names are lowercase for consistency

### [​](#managing-mcp-connections) Managing MCP connections

Use the `/mcp` command to:

- View all configured MCP servers
- Check connection status
- Authenticate with OAuth-enabled servers
- Clear authentication tokens
- View available tools and prompts from each server

### [​](#mcp-permissions-and-wildcards) MCP permissions and wildcards

To approve all tools from an MCP server, use either the server name alone or wildcard syntax:

- `mcp__github` (approves all GitHub tools)
- `mcp__github__*` (wildcard syntax, also approves all GitHub tools)

To approve specific tools, list each one explicitly:

- `mcp__github__get_issue`
- `mcp__github__list_issues`

See [MCP permission rules](/docs/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules) for more details.

## [​](#skill-tool) `Skill` tool

In earlier versions of Claude Code, slash command invocation was provided by a separate `SlashCommand` tool. This has been merged into the `Skill` tool.

The `Skill` tool allows Claude to programmatically invoke both [custom slash commands](/docs/en/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands) and [Agent Skills](/docs/en/skills) during a conversation. This gives Claude the ability to use these capabilities on your behalf when appropriate.

### [​](#what-the-skill-tool-can-invoke) What the `Skill` tool can invoke

The `Skill` tool provides access to:

| Type | Location | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom slash commands | `.claude/commands/` or `~/.claude/commands/` | Must have `description` frontmatter |
| Agent Skills | `.claude/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/` | Must not have `disable-model-invocation: true` |

Built-in commands like `/compact` and `/init` are *not* available through this tool.

### [​](#encourage-claude-to-use-specific-commands) Encourage Claude to use specific commands

To encourage Claude to use the `Skill` tool, reference the command by name, including the slash, in your prompts or `CLAUDE.md` file:

```bash
> Run /write-unit-test when you are about to start writing tests.
```

This tool puts each available command’s metadata into context up to the character budget limit. Use `/context` to monitor token usage.
To see which commands and Skills are available to the `Skill` tool, run `claude --debug` and trigger a query.

### [​](#disable-the-skill-tool) Disable the `Skill` tool

To prevent Claude from programmatically invoking any commands or Skills:

```bash
/permissions
# Add to deny rules: Skill
```

This removes the `Skill` tool and all command/Skill descriptions from context.

### [​](#disable-specific-commands-or-skills) Disable specific commands or Skills

To prevent a specific command or Skill from being invoked programmatically via the `Skill` tool, add `disable-model-invocation: true` to its frontmatter. This also removes the item’s metadata from context.

The `user-invocable` field in Skills only controls menu visibility, not `Skill` tool access. Use `disable-model-invocation: true` to block programmatic invocation. See [Control Skill visibility](/docs/en/skills#control-skill-visibility) for details.

### [​](#skill-permission-rules) `Skill` permission rules

The permission rules support:

- **Exact match**: `Skill(commit)` (allows only `commit` with no arguments)
- **Prefix match**: `Skill(review-pr:*)` (allows `review-pr` with any arguments)

### [​](#character-budget-limit) Character budget limit

The `Skill` tool includes a character budget to limit context usage. This prevents token overflow when many commands and Skills are available.
The budget includes each item’s name, arguments, and description.

- **Default limit**: 15,000 characters
- **Custom limit**: Set via `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable. The name is retained for backwards compatibility.

When the budget is exceeded, Claude sees only a subset of available items. In `/context`, a warning shows how many are included.

## [​](#skills-vs-slash-commands) Skills vs slash commands

**Slash commands** and **Agent Skills** serve different purposes in Claude Code:

### [​](#use-slash-commands-for) Use slash commands for

**Quick, frequently used prompts**:

- Simple prompt snippets you use often
- Quick reminders or templates
- Frequently used instructions that fit in one file

**Examples**:

- `/review` → “Review this code for bugs and suggest improvements”
- `/explain` → “Explain this code in simple terms”
- `/optimize` → “Analyze this code for performance issues”

### [​](#use-skills-for) Use Skills for

**Comprehensive capabilities with structure**:

- Complex workflows with multiple steps
- Capabilities requiring scripts or utilities
- Knowledge organized across multiple files
- Team workflows you want to standardize

**Examples**:

- PDF processing Skill with form-filling scripts and validation
- Data analysis Skill with reference docs for different data types
- Documentation Skill with style guides and templates

### [​](#key-differences) Key differences

| Aspect | Slash Commands | Agent Skills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Complexity** | Simple prompts | Complex capabilities |
| **Structure** | Single .md file | Directory with SKILL.md + resources |
| **Discovery** | Explicit invocation (`/command`) | Automatic (based on context) |
| **Files** | One file only | Multiple files, scripts, templates |
| **Scope** | Project or personal | Project or personal |
| **Sharing** | Via git | Via git |

### [​](#example-comparison) Example comparison

**As a slash command**:

```bash
# .claude/commands/review.md
Review this code for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code style violations
```

Usage: `/review` (manual invocation)
**As a Skill**:

```bash
.claude/skills/code-review/
├── SKILL.md (overview and workflows)
├── SECURITY.md (security checklist)
├── PERFORMANCE.md (performance patterns)
├── STYLE.md (style guide reference)
└── scripts/
    └── run-linters.sh
```

Usage: “Can you review this code?” (automatic discovery)
The Skill provides richer context, validation scripts, and organized reference material.

### [​](#when-to-use-each) When to use each

**Use slash commands**:

- You invoke the same prompt repeatedly
- The prompt fits in a single file
- You want explicit control over when it runs

**Use Skills**:

- Claude should discover the capability automatically
- Multiple files or scripts are needed
- Complex workflows with validation steps
- Team needs standardized, detailed guidance

Both slash commands and Skills can coexist. Use the approach that fits your needs.
Learn more about [Agent Skills](/docs/en/skills).

title: Status line configuration
---

Make Claude Code your own with a custom status line that displays at the bottom of the Claude Code interface, similar to how terminal prompts (PS1) work in shells like Oh-my-zsh.

## [​](#create-a-custom-status-line) Create a custom status line

You can either:

- Run `/statusline` to ask Claude Code to help you set up a custom status line. By default, it will try to reproduce your terminal’s prompt, but you can provide additional instructions about the behavior you want to Claude Code, such as `/statusline show the model name in orange`
- Directly add a `statusLine` command to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```bash
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/statusline.sh",
    "padding": 0 // Optional: set to 0 to let status line go to edge
  }
}
```

## [​](#how-it-works) How it Works

- The status line is updated when the conversation messages update
- Updates run at most every 300 ms
- The first line of stdout from your command becomes the status line text
- ANSI color codes are supported for styling your status line
- Claude Code passes contextual information about the current session (model, directories, etc.) as JSON to your script via stdin

## [​](#json-input-structure) JSON Input Structure

Your status line command receives structured data via stdin in JSON format:

```bash
{
  "hook_event_name": "Status",
  "session_id": "abc123...",
  "transcript_path": "/path/to/transcript.json",
  "cwd": "/current/working/directory",
  "model": {
    "id": "claude-opus-4-1",
    "display_name": "Opus"
  },
  "workspace": {
    "current_dir": "/current/working/directory",
    "project_dir": "/original/project/directory"
  },
  "version": "1.0.80",
  "output_style": {
    "name": "default"
  },
  "cost": {
    "total_cost_usd": 0.01234,

    "total_api_duration_ms": 2300,
    "total_lines_added": 156,
    "total_lines_removed": 23
  },
  "context_window": {
    "total_input_tokens": 15234,
    "total_output_tokens": 4521,
    "context_window_size": 200000,
    "used_percentage": 42.5,
    "remaining_percentage": 57.5,
    "current_usage": {
      "input_tokens": 8500,
      "output_tokens": 1200,
      "cache_creation_input_tokens": 5000,
      "cache_read_input_tokens": 2000
    }
  }
}
```

# Helper functions for common extractions
get_model_name() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.model.display_name'; }
get_current_dir() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.workspace.current_dir'; }

### [​](#context-window-usage) Context Window Usage

Display the percentage of context window consumed. The `context_window` object contains:

- `total_input_tokens` / `total_output_tokens`: Cumulative totals across the entire session
- `used_percentage`: Pre-calculated percentage of context window used (0-100)
- `remaining_percentage`: Pre-calculated percentage of context window remaining (0-100)
- `current_usage`: Current context window usage from the last API call (may be `null` if no messages yet)
  - `input_tokens`: Input tokens in current context
  - `output_tokens`: Output tokens generated
  - `cache_creation_input_tokens`: Tokens written to cache
  - `cache_read_input_tokens`: Tokens read from cache

You can use the pre-calculated `used_percentage` and `remaining_percentage` fields directly, or calculate from `current_usage` for more control.
**Simple approach using pre-calculated percentages:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)

MODEL=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.model.display_name')
PERCENT_USED=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.context_window.used_percentage // 0')

echo "[$MODEL] Context: ${PERCENT_USED}%"
```

**Advanced approach with manual calculation:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)

MODEL=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.model.display_name')
CONTEXT_SIZE=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.context_window.context_window_size')
USAGE=$(echo "$input" | jq '.context_window.current_usage')

if [ "$USAGE" != "null" ]; then
    # Calculate current context from current_usage fields
    CURRENT_TOKENS=$(echo "$USAGE" | jq '.input_tokens + .cache_creation_input_tokens + .cache_read_input_tokens')
    PERCENT_USED=$((CURRENT_TOKENS * 100 / CONTEXT_SIZE))
    echo "[$MODEL] Context: ${PERCENT_USED}%"
else
    echo "[$MODEL] Context: 0%"
fi
```

## [​](#tips) Tips

- Keep your status line concise - it should fit on one line
- Use emojis (if your terminal supports them) and colors to make information scannable
- Use `jq` for JSON parsing in Bash (see examples above)
- Test your script by running it manually with mock JSON input: `echo '{"model":{"display_name":"Test"},"workspace":{"current_dir":"/test"}}' | ./statusline.sh`
- Consider caching expensive operations (like git status) if needed

## [​](#troubleshooting) Troubleshooting

- If your status line doesn’t appear, check that your script is executable (`chmod +x`)
- Ensure your script outputs to stdout (not stderr)

title: Create custom subagents
---

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks. Each subagent runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions. When Claude encounters a task that matches a subagent’s description, it delegates to that subagent, which works independently and returns results.
Subagents help you:

- **Preserve context** by keeping exploration and implementation out of your main conversation
- **Enforce constraints** by limiting which tools a subagent can use
- **Reuse configurations** across projects with user-level subagents
- **Specialize behavior** with focused system prompts for specific domains
- **Control costs** by routing tasks to faster, cheaper models like Haiku

Claude uses each subagent’s description to decide when to delegate tasks. When you create a subagent, write a clear description so Claude knows when to use it.
Claude Code includes several built-in subagents like **Explore**, **Plan**, and **general-purpose**. You can also create custom subagents to handle specific tasks. This page covers the [built-in subagents](#built-in-subagents), [how to create your own](#quickstart-create-your-first-subagent), [full configuration options](#configure-subagents), [patterns for working with subagents](#work-with-subagents), and [example subagents](#example-subagents).

## [​](#built-in-subagents) Built-in subagents

Claude Code includes built-in subagents that Claude automatically uses when appropriate. Each inherits the parent conversation’s permissions with additional tool restrictions.

- Explore
- Plan
- General-purpose
- Other

A fast, read-only agent optimized for searching and analyzing codebases.

- **Model**: Haiku (fast, low-latency)
- **Tools**: Read-only tools (denied access to Write and Edit tools)
- **Purpose**: File discovery, code search, codebase exploration

Claude delegates to Explore when it needs to search or understand a codebase without making changes. This keeps exploration results out of your main conversation context.When invoking Explore, Claude specifies a thoroughness level: **quick** for targeted lookups, **medium** for balanced exploration, or **very thorough** for comprehensive analysis.

A research agent used during [plan mode](/docs/en/common-workflows#use-plan-mode-for-safe-code-analysis) to gather context before presenting a plan.

- **Model**: Inherits from main conversation
- **Tools**: Read-only tools (denied access to Write and Edit tools)
- **Purpose**: Codebase research for planning

When you’re in plan mode and Claude needs to understand your codebase, it delegates research to the Plan subagent. This prevents infinite nesting (subagents cannot spawn other subagents) while still gathering necessary context.

A capable agent for complex, multi-step tasks that require both exploration and action.

- **Model**: Inherits from main conversation
- **Tools**: All tools
- **Purpose**: Complex research, multi-step operations, code modifications

Claude delegates to general-purpose when the task requires both exploration and modification, complex reasoning to interpret results, or multiple dependent steps.

Claude Code includes additional helper agents for specific tasks. These are typically invoked automatically, so you don’t need to use them directly.

| Agent | Model | When Claude uses it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bash | Inherits | Running terminal commands in a separate context |
| statusline-setup | Sonnet | When you run `/statusline` to configure your status line |
| Claude Code Guide | Haiku | When you ask questions about Claude Code features |

Beyond these built-in subagents, you can create your own with custom prompts, tool restrictions, permission modes, hooks, and skills. The following sections show how to get started and customize subagents.

## [​](#quickstart:-create-your-first-subagent) Quickstart: create your first subagent

Subagents are defined in Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. You can [create them manually](#write-subagent-files) or use the `/agents` slash command.
This walkthrough guides you through creating a user-level subagent with the `/agent` command. The subagent reviews code and suggests improvements for the codebase.

1

Open the subagents interface

In Claude Code, run:

```bash
/agents
```

2

Create a new user-level agent

Select **Create new agent**, then choose **User-level**. This saves the subagent to `~/.claude/agents/` so it’s available in all your projects.

3

Generate with Claude

Select **Generate with Claude**. When prompted, describe the subagent:

```bash
A code improvement agent that scans files and suggests improvements
for readability, performance, and best practices. It should explain
each issue, show the current code, and provide an improved version.
```

Claude generates the system prompt and configuration. Press `e` to open it in your editor if you want to customize it.

4

Select tools

For a read-only reviewer, deselect everything except **Read-only tools**. If you keep all tools selected, the subagent inherits all tools available to the main conversation.

5

Select model

Choose which model the subagent uses. For this example agent, select **Sonnet**, which balances capability and speed for analyzing code patterns.

6

Choose a color

Pick a background color for the subagent. This helps you identify which subagent is running in the UI.

7

Save and try it out

Save the subagent. It’s available immediately (no restart needed). Try it:

```bash
Use the code-improver agent to suggest improvements in this project
```

Claude delegates to your new subagent, which scans the codebase and returns improvement suggestions.

You now have a subagent you can use in any project on your machine to analyze codebases and suggest improvements.
You can also create subagents manually as Markdown files, define them via CLI flags, or distribute them through plugins. The following sections cover all configuration options.

## [​](#configure-subagents) Configure subagents

### [​](#use-the-/agents-command) Use the /agents command

The `/agents` command provides an interactive interface for managing subagents. Run `/agents` to:

- View all available subagents (built-in, user, project, and plugin)
- Create new subagents with guided setup or Claude generation
- Edit existing subagent configuration and tool access
- Delete custom subagents
- See which subagents are active when duplicates exist

This is the recommended way to create and manage subagents. For manual creation or automation, you can also add subagent files directly.

### [​](#choose-the-subagent-scope) Choose the subagent scope

Subagents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Store them in different locations depending on scope. When multiple subagents share the same name, the higher-priority location wins.

| Location | Scope | Priority | How to create |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--agents` CLI flag | Current session | 1 (highest) | Pass JSON when launching Claude Code |
| `.claude/agents/` | Current project | 2 | Interactive or manual |
| `~/.claude/agents/` | All your projects | 3 | Interactive or manual |
| Plugin’s `agents/` directory | Where plugin is enabled | 4 (lowest) | Installed with [plugins](/docs/en/plugins) |

**Project subagents** (`.claude/agents/`) are ideal for subagents specific to a codebase. Check them into version control so your team can use and improve them collaboratively.
**User subagents** (`~/.claude/agents/`) are personal subagents available in all your projects.
**CLI-defined subagents** are passed as JSON when launching Claude Code. They exist only for that session and aren’t saved to disk, making them useful for quick testing or automation scripts:

```bash
claude --agents '{
  "code-reviewer": {
    "description": "Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes.",
    "prompt": "You are a senior code reviewer. Focus on code quality, security, and best practices.",
    "tools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"],
    "model": "sonnet"
  }
}'
```

The `--agents` flag accepts JSON with the same fields as [frontmatter](#supported-frontmatter-fields). Use `prompt` for the system prompt (equivalent to the markdown body in file-based subagents). See the [CLI reference](/docs/en/cli-reference#agents-flag-format) for the full JSON format.
**Plugin subagents** come from [plugins](/docs/en/plugins) you’ve installed. They appear in `/agents` alongside your custom subagents. See the [plugin components reference](/docs/en/plugins-reference#agents) for details on creating plugin subagents.

### [​](#write-subagent-files) Write subagent files

Subagent files use YAML frontmatter for configuration, followed by the system prompt in Markdown:

Subagents are loaded at session start. If you create a subagent by manually adding a file, restart your session or use `/agents` to load it immediately.

```bash
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality and best practices
tools: Read, Glob, Grep
model: sonnet
---

You are a code reviewer. When invoked, analyze the code and provide
specific, actionable feedback on quality, security, and best practices.
```

The frontmatter defines the subagent’s metadata and configuration. The body becomes the system prompt that guides the subagent’s behavior. Subagents receive only this system prompt (plus basic environment details like working directory), not the full Claude Code system prompt.

#### [​](#supported-frontmatter-fields) Supported frontmatter fields

The following fields can be used in the YAML frontmatter. Only `name` and `description` are required.

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier using lowercase letters and hyphens |
| `description` | Yes | When Claude should delegate to this subagent |
| `tools` | No | [Tools](#available-tools) the subagent can use. Inherits all tools if omitted |
| `disallowedTools` | No | Tools to deny, removed from inherited or specified list |
| `model` | No | [Model](#choose-a-model) to use: `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `inherit`. Defaults to `sonnet` |
| `permissionMode` | No | [Permission mode](#permission-modes): `default`, `acceptEdits`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`, or `plan` |
| `skills` | No | [Skills](/docs/en/skills) to load into the subagent’s context at startup. The full skill content is injected, not just made available for invocation. Subagents don’t inherit skills from the parent conversation |
| `hooks` | No | [Lifecycle hooks](#define-hooks-for-subagents) scoped to this subagent |

### [​](#choose-a-model) Choose a model

The `model` field controls which [AI model](/docs/en/model-config) the subagent uses:

- **Model alias**: Use one of the available aliases: `sonnet`, `opus`, or `haiku`
- **inherit**: Use the same model as the main conversation (useful for consistency)
- **Omitted**: If not specified, uses the default model configured for subagents (`sonnet`)

### [​](#control-subagent-capabilities) Control subagent capabilities

You can control what subagents can do through tool access, permission modes, and conditional rules.

#### [​](#available-tools) Available tools

Subagents can use any of Claude Code’s [internal tools](/docs/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude). By default, subagents inherit all tools from the main conversation, including MCP tools.
To restrict tools, use the `tools` field (allowlist) or `disallowedTools` field (denylist):

```bash
---
name: safe-researcher
description: Research agent with restricted capabilities
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
disallowedTools: Write, Edit
---
```

#### [​](#permission-modes) Permission modes

The `permissionMode` field controls how the subagent handles permission prompts. Subagents inherit the permission context from the main conversation but can override the mode.

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | Standard permission checking with prompts |
| `acceptEdits` | Auto-accept file edits |
| `dontAsk` | Auto-deny permission prompts (explicitly allowed tools still work) |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skip all permission checks |
| `plan` | Plan mode (read-only exploration) |

Use `bypassPermissions` with caution. It skips all permission checks, allowing the subagent to execute any operation without approval.

If the parent uses `bypassPermissions`, this takes precedence and cannot be overridden.

#### [​](#conditional-rules-with-hooks) Conditional rules with hooks

For more dynamic control over tool usage, use `PreToolUse` hooks to validate operations before they execute. This is useful when you need to allow some operations of a tool while blocking others.
This example creates a subagent that only allows read-only database queries. The `PreToolUse` hook runs the script specified in `command` before each Bash command executes:

```bash
---
name: db-reader
description: Execute read-only database queries
tools: Bash
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh"
---
```

Claude Code [passes hook input as JSON](/docs/en/hooks#pretooluse-input) via stdin to hook commands. The validation script reads this JSON, extracts the Bash command, and [exits with code 2](/docs/en/hooks#exit-code-2-behavior) to block write operations:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh

INPUT=$(cat)
COMMAND=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // empty')

# Block SQL write operations (case-insensitive)
if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -iE '\b(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|DROP|CREATE|ALTER|TRUNCATE)\b' > /dev/null; then
  echo "Blocked: Only SELECT queries are allowed" >&2
  exit 2
fi

exit 0
```

See [Hook input](/docs/en/hooks#pretooluse-input) for the complete input schema and [exit codes](/docs/en/hooks#exit-codes) for how exit codes affect behavior.

#### [​](#disable-specific-subagents) Disable specific subagents

You can prevent Claude from using specific subagents by adding them to the `deny` array in your [settings](/docs/en/settings#permission-settings). Use the format `Task(subagent-name)` where `subagent-name` matches the subagent’s name field.

```bash
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["Task(Explore)", "Task(my-custom-agent)"]
  }
}
```

This works for both built-in and custom subagents. You can also use the `--disallowedTools` CLI flag:

```bash
claude --disallowedTools "Task(Explore)"
```

See [IAM documentation](/docs/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules) for more details on permission rules.

### [​](#define-hooks-for-subagents) Define hooks for subagents

Subagents can define [hooks](/docs/en/hooks) that run during the subagent’s lifecycle. There are two ways to configure hooks:

1. **In the subagent’s frontmatter**: Define hooks that run only while that subagent is active
2. **In `settings.json`**: Define hooks that run in the main session when subagents start or stop

#### [​](#hooks-in-subagent-frontmatter) Hooks in subagent frontmatter

Define hooks directly in the subagent’s markdown file. These hooks only run while that specific subagent is active and are cleaned up when it finishes.

| Event | Matcher input | When it fires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PreToolUse` | Tool name | Before the subagent uses a tool |
| `PostToolUse` | Tool name | After the subagent uses a tool |
| `Stop` | (none) | When the subagent finishes |

This example validates Bash commands with the `PreToolUse` hook and runs a linter after file edits with `PostToolUse`:

```bash
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Review code changes with automatic linting
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-command.sh $TOOL_INPUT"
  PostToolUse:
    - matcher: "Edit|Write"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/run-linter.sh"
---
```

`Stop` hooks in frontmatter are automatically converted to `SubagentStop` events.

#### [​](#project-level-hooks-for-subagent-events) Project-level hooks for subagent events

Configure hooks in `settings.json` that respond to subagent lifecycle events in the main session. Use the `matcher` field to target specific agent types by name.

| Event | Matcher input | When it fires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SubagentStart` | Agent type name | When a subagent begins execution |
| `SubagentStop` | Agent type name | When a subagent completes |

This example runs setup and cleanup scripts only when the `db-agent` subagent starts and stops:

```bash
{
  "hooks": {
    "SubagentStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "db-agent",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "./scripts/setup-db-connection.sh" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "matcher": "db-agent",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "./scripts/cleanup-db-connection.sh" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See [Hooks](/docs/en/hooks) for the complete hook configuration format.

## [​](#work-with-subagents) Work with subagents

### [​](#understand-automatic-delegation) Understand automatic delegation

Claude automatically delegates tasks based on the task description in your request, the `description` field in subagent configurations, and current context. To encourage proactive delegation, include phrases like “use proactively” in your subagent’s description field.
You can also request a specific subagent explicitly:

```bash
Use the test-runner subagent to fix failing tests
Have the code-reviewer subagent look at my recent changes
```

### [​](#run-subagents-in-foreground-or-background) Run subagents in foreground or background

Subagents can run in the foreground (blocking) or background (concurrent):

- **Foreground subagents** block the main conversation until complete. Permission prompts and clarifying questions (like [`AskUserQuestion`](/docs/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude)) are passed through to you.
- **Background subagents** run concurrently while you continue working. They inherit the parent’s permissions and auto-deny anything not pre-approved. If a background subagent needs a permission it doesn’t have or needs to ask clarifying questions, that tool call fails but the subagent continues. MCP tools are not available in background subagents.

If a background subagent fails due to missing permissions, you can [resume it](#resume-subagents) in the foreground to retry with interactive prompts.
Claude decides whether to run subagents in the foreground or background based on the task. You can also:

- Ask Claude to “run this in the background”
- Press **Ctrl+B** to background a running task

To disable all background task functionality, set the `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS` environment variable to `1`. See [Environment variables](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables).

### [​](#common-patterns) Common patterns

#### [​](#isolate-high-volume-operations) Isolate high-volume operations

One of the most effective uses for subagents is isolating operations that produce large amounts of output. Running tests, fetching documentation, or processing log files can consume significant context. By delegating these to a subagent, the verbose output stays in the subagent’s context while only the relevant summary returns to your main conversation.

```bash
Use a subagent to run the test suite and report only the failing tests with their error messages
```

#### [​](#run-parallel-research) Run parallel research

For independent investigations, spawn multiple subagents to work simultaneously:

```bash
Research the authentication, database, and API modules in parallel using separate subagents
```

Each subagent explores its area independently, then Claude synthesizes the findings. This works best when the research paths don’t depend on each other.

When subagents complete, their results return to your main conversation. Running many subagents that each return detailed results can consume significant context.

#### [​](#chain-subagents) Chain subagents

For multi-step workflows, ask Claude to use subagents in sequence. Each subagent completes its task and returns results to Claude, which then passes relevant context to the next subagent.

```bash
Use the code-reviewer subagent to find performance issues, then use the optimizer subagent to fix them
```

### [​](#choose-between-subagents-and-main-conversation) Choose between subagents and main conversation

Use the **main conversation** when:

- The task needs frequent back-and-forth or iterative refinement
- Multiple phases share significant context (planning → implementation → testing)
- You’re making a quick, targeted change
- Latency matters. Subagents start fresh and may need time to gather context

Use **subagents** when:

- The task produces verbose output you don’t need in your main context
- You want to enforce specific tool restrictions or permissions
- The work is self-contained and can return a summary

Consider [Skills](/docs/en/skills) instead when you want reusable prompts or workflows that run in the main conversation context rather than isolated subagent context.

Subagents cannot spawn other subagents. If your workflow requires nested delegation, use [Skills](/docs/en/skills) or [chain subagents](#chain-subagents) from the main conversation.

### [​](#manage-subagent-context) Manage subagent context

#### [​](#resume-subagents) Resume subagents

Each subagent invocation creates a new instance with fresh context. To continue an existing subagent’s work instead of starting over, ask Claude to resume it.
Resumed subagents retain their full conversation history, including all previous tool calls, results, and reasoning. The subagent picks up exactly where it stopped rather than starting fresh.
When a subagent completes, Claude receives its agent ID. To resume a subagent, ask Claude to continue the previous work:

```bash
Use the code-reviewer subagent to review the authentication module
[Agent completes]

Continue that code review and now analyze the authorization logic
[Claude resumes the subagent with full context from previous conversation]
```

You can also ask Claude for the agent ID if you want to reference it explicitly, or find IDs in the transcript files at `~/.claude/projects/{project}/{sessionId}/subagents/`. Each transcript is stored as `agent-{agentId}.jsonl`.
For programmatic usage, see [Subagents in the Agent SDK](/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents).
Subagent transcripts persist independently of the main conversation:

- **Main conversation compaction**: When the main conversation compacts, subagent transcripts are unaffected. They’re stored in separate files.
- **Session persistence**: Subagent transcripts persist within their session. You can [resume a subagent](#resume-subagents) after restarting Claude Code by resuming the same session.
- **Automatic cleanup**: Transcripts are cleaned up based on the `cleanupPeriodDays` setting (default: 30 days).

#### [​](#auto-compaction) Auto-compaction

Subagents support automatic compaction using the same logic as the main conversation. By default, auto-compaction triggers at approximately 95% capacity. To trigger compaction earlier, set `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` to a lower percentage (for example, `50`). See [environment variables](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) for details.
Compaction events are logged in subagent transcript files:

```bash
{
  "type": "system",
  "subtype": "compact_boundary",
  "compactMetadata": {
    "trigger": "auto",
    "preTokens": 167189
  }
}
```

The `preTokens` value shows how many tokens were used before compaction occurred.

## [​](#example-subagents) Example subagents

These examples demonstrate effective patterns for building subagents. Use them as starting points, or generate a customized version with Claude.

**Best practices:**

- **Design focused subagents:** each subagent should excel at one specific task
- **Write detailed descriptions:** Claude uses the description to decide when to delegate
- **Limit tool access:** grant only necessary permissions for security and focus
- **Check into version control:** share project subagents with your team

### [​](#code-reviewer) Code reviewer

A read-only subagent that reviews code without modifying it. This example shows how to design a focused subagent with limited tool access (no Edit or Write) and a detailed prompt that specifies exactly what to look for and how to format output.

```bash
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: inherit
---

You are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards of code quality and security.

When invoked:
1. Run git diff to see recent changes
2. Focus on modified files
3. Begin review immediately

Review checklist:
- Code is clear and readable
- Functions and variables are well-named
- No duplicated code
- Proper error handling
- No exposed secrets or API keys
- Input validation implemented
- Good test coverage
- Performance considerations addressed

Provide feedback organized by priority:
- Critical issues (must fix)
- Warnings (should fix)
- Suggestions (consider improving)

Include specific examples of how to fix issues.
```

### [​](#debugger) Debugger

A subagent that can both analyze and fix issues. Unlike the code reviewer, this one includes Edit because fixing bugs requires modifying code. The prompt provides a clear workflow from diagnosis to verification.

```bash
---
name: debugger
description: Debugging specialist for errors, test failures, and unexpected behavior. Use proactively when encountering any issues.
tools: Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

You are an expert debugger specializing in root cause analysis.

When invoked:
1. Capture error message and stack trace
2. Identify reproduction steps
3. Isolate the failure location
4. Implement minimal fix
5. Verify solution works

Debugging process:
- Analyze error messages and logs
- Check recent code changes
- Form and test hypotheses
- Add strategic debug logging
- Inspect variable states

For each issue, provide:
- Root cause explanation
- Evidence supporting the diagnosis
- Specific code fix
- Testing approach
- Prevention recommendations

Focus on fixing the underlying issue, not the symptoms.
```

### [​](#data-scientist) Data scientist

A domain-specific subagent for data analysis work. This example shows how to create subagents for specialized workflows outside of typical coding tasks. It explicitly sets `model: sonnet` for more capable analysis.

```bash
---
name: data-scientist
description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
tools: Bash, Read, Write
model: sonnet
---

You are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.

When invoked:
1. Understand the data analysis requirement
2. Write efficient SQL queries
3. Use BigQuery command line tools (bq) when appropriate
4. Analyze and summarize results
5. Present findings clearly

Key practices:
- Write optimized SQL queries with proper filters
- Use appropriate aggregations and joins
- Include comments explaining complex logic
- Format results for readability
- Provide data-driven recommendations

For each analysis:
- Explain the query approach
- Document any assumptions
- Highlight key findings
- Suggest next steps based on data

Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.
```

### [​](#database-query-validator) Database query validator

A subagent that allows Bash access but validates commands to permit only read-only SQL queries. This example shows how to use `PreToolUse` hooks for conditional validation when you need finer control than the `tools` field provides.

```bash
---
name: db-reader
description: Execute read-only database queries. Use when analyzing data or generating reports.
tools: Bash
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh"
---

You are a database analyst with read-only access. Execute SELECT queries to answer questions about the data.

When asked to analyze data:
1. Identify which tables contain the relevant data
2. Write efficient SELECT queries with appropriate filters
3. Present results clearly with context

You cannot modify data. If asked to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or modify schema, explain that you only have read access.
```

Claude Code [passes hook input as JSON](/docs/en/hooks#pretooluse-input) via stdin to hook commands. The validation script reads this JSON, extracts the command being executed, and checks it against a list of SQL write operations. If a write operation is detected, the script [exits with code 2](/docs/en/hooks#exit-code-2-behavior) to block execution and returns an error message to Claude via stderr.
Create the validation script anywhere in your project. The path must match the `command` field in your hook configuration:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Blocks SQL write operations, allows SELECT queries

# Read JSON input from stdin
INPUT=$(cat)

# Extract the command field from tool_input using jq
COMMAND=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // empty')

if [ -z "$COMMAND" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

# Block write operations (case-insensitive)
if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -iE '\b(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|DROP|CREATE|ALTER|TRUNCATE|REPLACE|MERGE)\b' > /dev/null; then
  echo "Blocked: Write operations not allowed. Use SELECT queries only." >&2
  exit 2
fi

exit 0
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh
```

The hook receives JSON via stdin with the Bash command in `tool_input.command`. Exit code 2 blocks the operation and feeds the error message back to Claude. See [Hooks](/docs/en/hooks#exit-codes) for details on exit codes and [Hook input](/docs/en/hooks#pretooluse-input) for the complete input schema.

### [​](#themes-and-appearance) Themes and appearance

Claude cannot control the theme of your terminal. That’s handled by your terminal application. You can match Claude Code’s theme to your terminal any time via the `/config` command.
For additional customization of the Claude Code interface itself, you can configure a [custom status line](/docs/en/statusline) to display contextual information like the current model, working directory, or git branch at the bottom of your terminal.

### [​](#line-breaks) Line breaks

You have several options for entering line breaks into Claude Code:

- **Quick escape**: Type `\` followed by Enter to create a newline
- **Shift+Enter**: Works out of the box in iTerm2, WezTerm, Ghostty, and Kitty
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Set up a keybinding to insert a newline in other terminals

**Set up Shift+Enter for other terminals**
Run `/terminal-setup` within Claude Code to automatically configure Shift+Enter for VS Code, Alacritty, Zed, and Warp.

The `/terminal-setup` command is only visible in terminals that require manual configuration. If you’re using iTerm2, WezTerm, Ghostty, or Kitty, you won’t see this command because Shift+Enter already works natively.

**Set up Option+Enter (VS Code, iTerm2 or macOS Terminal.app)**
**For Mac Terminal.app:**

1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keyboard
2. Check “Use Option as Meta Key”

**For iTerm2 and VS Code terminal:**

1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keys
2. Under General, set Left/Right Option key to “Esc+“

### [​](#notification-setup) Notification setup

Never miss when Claude completes a task with proper notification configuration:

#### [​](#iterm-2-system-notifications) iTerm 2 system notifications

For iTerm 2 alerts when tasks complete:

1. Open iTerm 2 Preferences
2. Navigate to Profiles → Terminal
3. Enable “Silence bell” and Filter Alerts → “Send escape sequence-generated alerts”
4. Set your preferred notification delay

Note that these notifications are specific to iTerm 2 and not available in the default macOS Terminal.

#### [​](#custom-notification-hooks) Custom notification hooks

For advanced notification handling, you can create [notification hooks](/docs/en/hooks#notification) to run your own logic.

### [​](#handling-large-inputs) Handling large inputs

When working with extensive code or long instructions:

- **Avoid direct pasting**: Claude Code may struggle with very long pasted content
- **Use file-based workflows**: Write content to a file and ask Claude to read it
- **Be aware of VS Code limitations**: The VS Code terminal is particularly prone to truncating long pastes

### [​](#vim-mode) Vim Mode

Claude Code supports a subset of Vim keybindings that can be enabled with `/vim` or configured via `/config`.
The supported subset includes:

- Mode switching: `Esc` (to NORMAL), `i`/`I`, `a`/`A`, `o`/`O` (to INSERT)
- Navigation: `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`, `w`/`e`/`b`, `0`/`$`/`^`, `gg`/`G`, `f`/`F`/`t`/`T` with `;`/`,` repeat
- Editing: `x`, `dw`/`de`/`db`/`dd`/`D`, `cw`/`ce`/`cb`/`cc`/`C`, `.` (repeat)
- Yank/paste: `yy`/`Y`, `yw`/`ye`/`yb`, `p`/`P`
- Text objects: `iw`/`aw`, `iW`/`aW`, `i"`/`a"`, `i'`/`a'`, `i(`/`a(`, `i[`/`a[`, `i{`/`a{`
- Indentation: `>>`/`<<`
- Line operations: `J` (join lines)

See [Interactive mode](/docs/en/interactive-mode#vim-editor-mode) for the complete reference.

## [​](#configure-proxies-and-gateways) Configure proxies and gateways

Most organizations can use a cloud provider directly without additional configuration. However, you may need to configure a corporate proxy or LLM gateway if your organization has specific network or management requirements. These are different configurations that can be used together:

- **Corporate proxy**: Routes traffic through an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Use this if your organization requires all outbound traffic to pass through a proxy server for security monitoring, compliance, or network policy enforcement. Configure with the `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables. Learn more in [Enterprise network configuration](/docs/en/network-config).
- **LLM Gateway**: A service that sits between Claude Code and the cloud provider to handle authentication and routing. Use this if you need centralized usage tracking across teams, custom rate limiting or budgets, or centralized authentication management. Configure with the `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL`, or `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL` environment variables. Learn more in [LLM gateway configuration](/docs/en/llm-gateway).

The following examples show the environment variables to set in your shell or shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`). See [Settings](/docs/en/settings) for other configuration methods.

### [​](#amazon-bedrock) Amazon Bedrock

- Corporate proxy
- LLM Gateway

Route Bedrock traffic through your corporate proxy by setting the following [environment variables](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables):

```bash
# Enable Bedrock
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Configure corporate proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY='https://proxy.example.com:8080'
```

Route Bedrock traffic through your LLM gateway by setting the following [environment variables](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables):

```bash
# Enable Bedrock
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1

# Configure LLM gateway
export ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL='https://your-llm-gateway.com/bedrock'
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH=1  # If gateway handles AWS auth
```

### [​](#microsoft-foundry) Microsoft Foundry

- Corporate proxy
- LLM Gateway

Route Foundry traffic through your corporate proxy by setting the following [environment variables](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables):

```bash
# Enable Microsoft Foundry
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1
export ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_RESOURCE=your-resource
export ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_API_KEY=your-api-key  # Or omit for Entra ID auth

# Configure corporate proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY='https://proxy.example.com:8080'
```

Route Foundry traffic through your LLM gateway by setting the following [environment variables](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables):

```bash
# Enable Microsoft Foundry
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1

# Configure LLM gateway
export ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_BASE_URL='https://your-llm-gateway.com'
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_FOUNDRY_AUTH=1  # If gateway handles Azure auth
```

### [​](#google-vertex-ai) Google Vertex AI

- Corporate proxy
- LLM Gateway

Route Vertex AI traffic through your corporate proxy by setting the following [environment variables](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables):

```bash
# Enable Vertex
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
export CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# Configure corporate proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY='https://proxy.example.com:8080'
```

Route Vertex AI traffic through your LLM gateway by setting the following [environment variables](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables):

```bash
# Enable Vertex
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1

# Configure LLM gateway
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL='https://your-llm-gateway.com/vertex'
export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1  # If gateway handles GCP auth
```

Use `/status` in Claude Code to verify your proxy and gateway configuration is applied correctly.

## [​](#best-practices-for-organizations) Best practices for organizations

### [​](#invest-in-documentation-and-memory) Invest in documentation and memory

We strongly recommend investing in documentation so that Claude Code understands your codebase. Organizations can deploy CLAUDE.md files at multiple levels:

- **Organization-wide**: Deploy to system directories like `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md` (macOS) for company-wide standards
- **Repository-level**: Create `CLAUDE.md` files in repository roots containing project architecture, build commands, and contribution guidelines. Check these into source control so all users benefit

Learn more in [Memory and CLAUDE.md files](/docs/en/memory).

### [​](#simplify-deployment) Simplify deployment

If you have a custom development environment, we find that creating a “one click” way to install Claude Code is key to growing adoption across an organization.

### [​](#start-with-guided-usage) Start with guided usage

Encourage new users to try Claude Code for codebase Q&A, or on smaller bug fixes or feature requests. Ask Claude Code to make a plan. Check Claude’s suggestions and give feedback if it’s off-track. Over time, as users understand this new paradigm better, then they’ll be more effective at letting Claude Code run more agentically.

### [​](#configure-security-policies) Configure security policies

Security teams can configure managed permissions for what Claude Code is and is not allowed to do, which cannot be overwritten by local configuration. [Learn more](/docs/en/security).

### [​](#leverage-mcp-for-integrations) Leverage MCP for integrations

MCP is a great way to give Claude Code more information, such as connecting to ticket management systems or error logs. We recommend that one central team configures MCP servers and checks a `.mcp.json` configuration into the codebase so that all users benefit. [Learn more](/docs/en/mcp).
At Anthropic, we trust Claude Code to power development across every Anthropic codebase. We hope you enjoy using Claude Code as much as we do.

## [​](#next-steps) Next steps

Once you’ve chosen a deployment option and configured access for your team:

1. **Roll out to your team**: Share installation instructions and have team members [install Claude Code](/docs/en/setup) and authenticate with their credentials.
2. **Set up shared configuration**: Create a [CLAUDE.md file](/docs/en/memory) in your repositories to help Claude Code understand your codebase and coding standards.
3. **Configure permissions**: Review [security settings](/docs/en/security) to define what Claude Code can and cannot do in your environment.

## [​](#common-installation-issues) Common installation issues

### [​](#windows-installation-issues:-errors-in-wsl) Windows installation issues: errors in WSL

You might encounter the following issues in WSL:
**OS/platform detection issues**: If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows `npm`. Try:

- Run `npm config set os linux` before installation
- Install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check` (Do NOT use `sudo`)

**Node not found errors**: If you see `exec: node: not found` when running `claude`, your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with `which npm` and `which node`, which should point to Linux paths starting with `/usr/` rather than `/mnt/c/`. To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution’s package manager or via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
**nvm version conflicts**: If you have nvm installed in both WSL and Windows, you may experience version conflicts when switching Node versions in WSL. This happens because WSL imports the Windows PATH by default, causing Windows nvm/npm to take priority over the WSL installation.
You can identify this issue by:

- Running `which npm` and `which node` - if they point to Windows paths (starting with `/mnt/c/`), Windows versions are being used
- Experiencing broken functionality after switching Node versions with nvm in WSL

To resolve this issue, fix your Linux PATH to ensure the Linux node/npm versions take priority:
**Primary solution: Ensure nvm is properly loaded in your shell**
The most common cause is that nvm isn’t loaded in non-interactive shells. Add the following to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
# Load nvm if it exists
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```

Or run directly in your current session:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

**Alternative: Adjust PATH order**
If nvm is properly loaded but Windows paths still take priority, you can explicitly prepend your Linux paths to PATH in your shell configuration:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/$(node -v)/bin:$PATH"
```

Avoid disabling Windows PATH importing (`appendWindowsPath = false`) as this breaks the ability to call Windows executables from WSL. Similarly, avoid uninstalling Node.js from Windows if you use it for Windows development.

### [​](#linux-and-mac-installation-issues:-permission-or-command-not-found-errors) Linux and Mac installation issues: permission or command not found errors

When installing Claude Code with npm, `PATH` problems may prevent access to `claude`.
You may also encounter permission errors if your npm global prefix is not user writable (for example, `/usr`, or `/usr/local`).

#### [​](#recommended-solution:-native-claude-code-installation) Recommended solution: Native Claude Code installation

Claude Code has a native installation that doesn’t depend on npm or Node.js.
Use the following command to run the native installer.
**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

```bash
# Install stable version (default)
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Install latest version
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s latest

# Install specific version number
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s 1.0.58
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```bash
# Install stable version (default)
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex

# Install latest version
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1))) latest

# Install specific version number
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1))) 1.0.58
```

This command installs the appropriate build of Claude Code for your operating system and architecture and adds a symlink to the installation at `~/.local/bin/claude` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\claude.exe` on Windows).

Make sure that you have the installation directory in your system PATH.

### [​](#windows:-“claude-code-on-windows-requires-git-bash”) Windows: “Claude Code on Windows requires git-bash”

Claude Code on native Windows requires [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) which includes Git Bash. If Git is installed but not detected:

1. Set the path explicitly in PowerShell before running Claude:

   ```bash
   $env:CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH="C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
   ```
2. Or add it to your system environment variables permanently through System Properties → Environment Variables.

If Git is installed in a non-standard location, adjust the path accordingly.

### [​](#windows:-“installmethod-is-native,-but-claude-command-not-found”) Windows: “installMethod is native, but claude command not found”

If you see this error after installation, the `claude` command isn’t in your PATH. Add it manually:

1

Open Environment Variables

Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press Enter. Click **Advanced** → **Environment Variables**.

2

Edit User PATH

Under “User variables”, select **Path** and click **Edit**. Click **New** and add:

```bash
%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin
```

3

Restart your terminal

Close and reopen PowerShell or CMD for changes to take effect.

Verify installation:

```bash
claude doctor # Check installation health
```

## [​](#permissions-and-authentication) Permissions and authentication

### [​](#repeated-permission-prompts) Repeated permission prompts

If you find yourself repeatedly approving the same commands, you can allow specific tools
to run without approval using the `/permissions` command. See [Permissions docs](/docs/en/iam#configuring-permissions).

### [​](#authentication-issues) Authentication issues

If you’re experiencing authentication problems:

1. Run `/logout` to sign out completely
2. Close Claude Code
3. Restart with `claude` and complete the authentication process again

If problems persist, try:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/claude-code/auth.json
claude
```

This removes your stored authentication information and forces a clean login.

## [​](#configuration-file-locations) Configuration file locations

Claude Code stores configuration in several locations:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | User settings (permissions, hooks, model overrides) |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Project settings (checked into source control) |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | Local project settings (not committed) |
| `~/.claude.json` | Global state (theme, OAuth, MCP servers, allowed tools) |
| `.mcp.json` | Project MCP servers (checked into source control) |
| `managed-settings.json` | [Managed settings](/docs/en/settings#settings-files) |
| `managed-mcp.json` | [Managed MCP servers](/docs/en/mcp#managed-mcp-configuration) |

On Windows, `~` refers to your user home directory, such as `C:\Users\YourName`.
**Managed file locations:**

- macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/`
- Linux/WSL: `/etc/claude-code/`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\`

For details on configuring these files, see [Settings](/docs/en/settings) and [MCP](/docs/en/mcp).

### [​](#resetting-configuration) Resetting configuration

To reset Claude Code to default settings, you can remove the configuration files:

```bash
# Reset all user settings and state
rm ~/.claude.json
rm -rf ~/.claude/

# Reset project-specific settings
rm -rf .claude/
rm .mcp.json
```

This will remove all your settings, allowed tools, MCP server configurations, and session history.

## [​](#performance-and-stability) Performance and stability

### [​](#high-cpu-or-memory-usage) High CPU or memory usage

Claude Code is designed to work with most development environments, but may consume significant resources when processing large codebases. If you’re experiencing performance issues:

1. Use `/compact` regularly to reduce context size
2. Close and restart Claude Code between major tasks
3. Consider adding large build directories to your `.gitignore` file

### [​](#command-hangs-or-freezes) Command hangs or freezes

If Claude Code seems unresponsive:

1. Press Ctrl+C to attempt to cancel the current operation
2. If unresponsive, you may need to close the terminal and restart

### [​](#search-and-discovery-issues) Search and discovery issues

If Search tool, `@file` mentions, custom agents, and custom slash commands aren’t working, install system `ripgrep`:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install ripgrep

# Windows (winget)
winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ripgrep

# Alpine Linux
apk add ripgrep

# Arch Linux
pacman -S ripgrep
```

Then set `USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0` in your [environment](/docs/en/settings#environment-variables).

### [​](#slow-or-incomplete-search-results-on-wsl) Slow or incomplete search results on WSL

Disk read performance penalties when [working across file systems on WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems) may result in fewer-than-expected matches (but not a complete lack of search functionality) when using Claude Code on WSL.

`/doctor` will show Search as OK in this case.

**Solutions:**

1. **Submit more specific searches**: Reduce the number of files searched by specifying directories or file types: “Search for JWT validation logic in the auth-service package” or “Find use of md5 hash in JS files”.
2. **Move project to Linux filesystem**: If possible, ensure your project is located on the Linux filesystem (`/home/`) rather than the Windows filesystem (`/mnt/c/`).
3. **Use native Windows instead**: Consider running Claude Code natively on Windows instead of through WSL, for better file system performance.

## [​](#ide-integration-issues) IDE integration issues

### [​](#jetbrains-ide-not-detected-on-wsl2) JetBrains IDE not detected on WSL2

If you’re using Claude Code on WSL2 with JetBrains IDEs and getting “No available IDEs detected” errors, this is likely due to WSL2’s networking configuration or Windows Firewall blocking the connection.

#### [​](#wsl2-networking-modes) WSL2 networking modes

WSL2 uses NAT networking by default, which can prevent IDE detection. You have two options:
**Option 1: Configure Windows Firewall** (recommended)

1. Find your WSL2 IP address:

   ```bash
   wsl hostname -I
   # Example output: 172.21.123.456
   ```
2. Open PowerShell as Administrator and create a firewall rule:

   ```bash
   New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow WSL2 Internal Traffic" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -RemoteAddress 172.21.0.0/16 -LocalAddress 172.21.0.0/16
   ```

   (Adjust the IP range based on your WSL2 subnet from step 1)
3. Restart both your IDE and Claude Code

**Option 2: Switch to mirrored networking**
Add to `.wslconfig` in your Windows user directory:

```bash
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

Then restart WSL with `wsl --shutdown` from PowerShell.

These networking issues only affect WSL2. WSL1 uses the host’s network directly and doesn’t require these configurations.

For additional JetBrains configuration tips, see our [JetBrains IDE guide](/docs/en/jetbrains#plugin-settings).

### [​](#reporting-windows-ide-integration-issues-both-native-and-wsl) Reporting Windows IDE integration issues (both native and WSL)

If you’re experiencing IDE integration problems on Windows, [create an issue](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues) with the following information:

- Environment type: native Windows (Git Bash) or WSL1/WSL2
- WSL networking mode (if applicable): NAT or mirrored
- IDE name and version
- Claude Code extension/plugin version
- Shell type: Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, etc.

### [​](#escape-key-not-working-in-jetbrains-intellij,-pycharm,-etc-terminals) Escape key not working in JetBrains (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.) terminals

If you’re using Claude Code in JetBrains terminals and the `Esc` key doesn’t interrupt the agent as expected, this is likely due to a keybinding clash with JetBrains’ default shortcuts.
To fix this issue:

1. Go to Settings → Tools → Terminal
2. Either:
   - Uncheck “Move focus to the editor with Escape”, or
   - Click “Configure terminal keybindings” and delete the “Switch focus to Editor” shortcut
3. Apply the changes

This allows the `Esc` key to properly interrupt Claude Code operations.

## [​](#markdown-formatting-issues) Markdown formatting issues

Claude Code sometimes generates markdown files with missing language tags on code fences, which can affect syntax highlighting and readability in GitHub, editors, and documentation tools.

### [​](#missing-language-tags-in-code-blocks) Missing language tags in code blocks

If you notice code blocks like this in generated markdown:

```bash
```
function example() {
  return "hello";
}
```
```

Instead of properly tagged blocks like:

```bash
```javascript
function example() {
  return "hello";
}
```
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Ask Claude to add language tags**: Request “Add appropriate language tags to all code blocks in this markdown file.”
2. **Use post-processing hooks**: Set up automatic formatting hooks to detect and add missing language tags. See the [markdown formatting hook example](/docs/en/hooks-guide#markdown-formatting-hook) for implementation details.
3. **Manual verification**: After generating markdown files, review them for proper code block formatting and request corrections if needed.

### [​](#inconsistent-spacing-and-formatting) Inconsistent spacing and formatting

If generated markdown has excessive blank lines or inconsistent spacing:
**Solutions:**

1. **Request formatting corrections**: Ask Claude to “Fix spacing and formatting issues in this markdown file.”
2. **Use formatting tools**: Set up hooks to run markdown formatters like `prettier` or custom formatting scripts on generated markdown files.
3. **Specify formatting preferences**: Include formatting requirements in your prompts or project [memory](/docs/en/memory) files.

### [​](#best-practices-for-markdown-generation) Best practices for markdown generation

To minimize formatting issues:

- **Be explicit in requests**: Ask for “properly formatted markdown with language-tagged code blocks”
- **Use project conventions**: Document your preferred markdown style in [`CLAUDE.md`](/docs/en/memory)
- **Set up validation hooks**: Use post-processing hooks to automatically verify and fix common formatting issues

## [​](#getting-more-help) Getting more help

If you’re experiencing issues not covered here:

1. Use the `/bug` command within Claude Code to report problems directly to Anthropic
2. Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) for known issues
3. Run `/doctor` to diagnose issues. It checks:
   - Installation type, version, and search functionality
   - Auto-update status and available versions
   - Invalid settings files (malformed JSON, incorrect types)
   - MCP server configuration errors
   - Keybinding configuration problems
   - Context usage warnings (large CLAUDE.md files, high MCP token usage, unreachable permission rules)
   - Plugin and agent loading errors
4. Ask Claude directly about its capabilities and features - Claude has built-in access to its documentation

![VS Code editor with the Claude Code extension panel open on the right side, showing a conversation with Claude](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/-YhHHmtSxwr7W8gy/images/vs-code-extension-interface.jpg?fit=max&auto=format&n=-YhHHmtSxwr7W8gy&q=85&s=300652d5678c63905e6b0ea9e50835f8)
The VS Code extension provides a native graphical interface for Claude Code, integrated directly into your IDE. This is the recommended way to use Claude Code in VS Code.
With the extension, you can review and edit Claude’s plans before accepting them, auto-accept edits as they’re made, @-mention files with specific line ranges from your selection, access conversation history, and open multiple conversations in separate tabs or windows.

## [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

- VS Code 1.98.0 or higher
- An Anthropic account (you’ll sign in when you first open the extension). If you’re using a third-party provider like Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI, see [Use third-party providers](#use-third-party-providers) instead.

You don’t need to install the Claude Code CLI first. However, some features like MCP server configuration require the CLI. See [VS Code extension vs. Claude Code CLI](#vs-code-extension-vs-claude-code-cli) for details.

## [​](#install-the-extension) Install the extension

Click the link for your IDE to install directly:

- [Install for VS Code](vscode:extension/anthropic.claude-code)
- [Install for Cursor](cursor:extension/anthropic.claude-code)

Or in VS Code, press `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) to open the Extensions view, search for “Claude Code”, and click **Install**.

You may need to restart VS Code or run “Developer: Reload Window” from the Command Palette after installation.

## [​](#get-started) Get started

Once installed, you can start using Claude Code through the VS Code interface:

1

Open the Claude Code panel

Throughout VS Code, the Spark icon indicates Claude Code: ![Spark icon](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/mfM-EyoZGnQv8JTc/images/vs-code-spark-icon.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=mfM-EyoZGnQv8JTc&q=85&s=a734d84e785140016672f08e0abb236c)The quickest way to open Claude is to click the Spark icon in the **Editor Toolbar** (top-right corner of the editor). The icon only appears when you have a file open.![VS Code editor showing the Spark icon in the Editor Toolbar](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/mfM-EyoZGnQv8JTc/images/vs-code-editor-icon.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=mfM-EyoZGnQv8JTc&q=85&s=eb4540325d94664c51776dbbfec4cf02)Other ways to open Claude Code:

- **Command Palette**: `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux), type “Claude Code”, and select an option like “Open in New Tab”
- **Status Bar**: Click **✱ Claude Code** in the bottom-right corner of the window. This works even when no file is open.

You can drag the Claude panel to reposition it anywhere in VS Code. See [Customize your workflow](#customize-your-workflow) for details.

2

Send a prompt

Ask Claude to help with your code or files, whether that’s explaining how something works, debugging an issue, or making changes.

Select text in the editor and press `Alt+K` to insert an @-mention with the file path and line numbers directly into your prompt.

Here’s an example of asking about a particular line in a file:![VS Code editor with lines 2-3 selected in a Python file, and the Claude Code panel showing a question about those lines with an @-mention reference](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/FVYz38sRY-VuoGHA/images/vs-code-send-prompt.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=FVYz38sRY-VuoGHA&q=85&s=ede3ed8d8d5f940e01c5de636d009cfd)

3

Review changes

When Claude wants to edit a file, it shows you a diff and asks for permission. You can accept, reject, or tell Claude what to do instead.![VS Code showing a diff of Claude's proposed changes with a permission prompt asking whether to make the edit](https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/FVYz38sRY-VuoGHA/images/vs-code-edits.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=FVYz38sRY-VuoGHA&q=85&s=e005f9b41c541c5c7c59c082f7c4841c)

For more ideas on what you can do with Claude Code, see [Common workflows](/docs/en/common-workflows).

## [​](#customize-your-workflow) Customize your workflow

Once you’re up and running, you can reposition the Claude panel or switch to terminal mode.

### [​](#change-the-layout) Change the layout

You can drag the Claude panel to reposition it anywhere in VS Code. Grab the panel’s tab or title bar and drag it to:

- **Secondary sidebar** (default): The right side of the window
- **Primary sidebar**: The left sidebar with icons for Explorer, Search, etc.
- **Editor area**: Opens Claude as a tab alongside your files

The Spark icon only appears in the Activity Bar (left sidebar icons) when the Claude panel is docked to the left. Since Claude defaults to the right side, use the Editor Toolbar icon to open Claude.

### [​](#switch-to-terminal-mode) Switch to terminal mode

By default, the extension opens a graphical chat panel. If you prefer the CLI-style interface, open the [Use Terminal setting](vscode://settings/claudeCode.useTerminal) and check the box.
You can also open VS Code settings (`Cmd+,` on Mac or `Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux), go to Extensions → Claude Code, and check **Use Terminal**.

## [​](#vs-code-commands-and-shortcuts) VS Code commands and shortcuts

Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux) and type “Claude Code” to see all available VS Code commands for the Claude Code extension:

These are VS Code commands for controlling the extension. For Claude Code slash commands (like `/help` or `/compact`), not all CLI commands are available in the extension yet. See [VS Code extension vs. Claude Code CLI](#vs-code-extension-vs-claude-code-cli) for details.

| Command | Shortcut | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Focus Input | `Cmd+Esc` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Esc` (Windows/Linux) | Toggle focus between editor and Claude |
| Open in Side Bar | — | Open Claude in the left sidebar |
| Open in Terminal | — | Open Claude in terminal mode |
| Open in New Tab | `Cmd+Shift+Esc` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` (Windows/Linux) | Open a new conversation as an editor tab |
| Open in New Window | — | Open a new conversation in a separate window |
| New Conversation | `Cmd+N` (Mac) / `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux) | Start a new conversation (when Claude is focused) |
| Insert @-Mention Reference | `Alt+K` | Insert a reference to the current file (includes line numbers if text is selected) |
| Show Logs | — | View extension debug logs |
| Logout | — | Sign out of your Anthropic account |

Use **Open in New Tab** or **Open in New Window** to run multiple conversations simultaneously. Each tab or window maintains its own conversation history and context.

## [​](#configure-settings) Configure settings

The extension has two types of settings:

- **Extension settings**: Open with `Cmd+,` (Mac) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux), then go to Extensions → Claude Code.

  | Setting | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | Selected Model | Default model for new conversations. Change per-session with `/model`. |
  | Use Terminal | Launch Claude in terminal mode instead of graphical panel |
  | Initial Permission Mode | Controls approval prompts for file edits and commands. Defaults to `default` (ask before each action). |
  | Preferred Location | Default location: sidebar (right) or panel (new tab) |
  | Autosave | Auto-save files before Claude reads or writes them |
  | Use Ctrl+Enter to Send | Use Ctrl/Cmd+Enter instead of Enter to send prompts |
  | Enable New Conversation Shortcut | Enable Cmd/Ctrl+N to start a new conversation |
  | Respect Git Ignore | Exclude .gitignore patterns from file searches |
  | Environment Variables | Set environment variables for the Claude process. **Not recommended**—use [Claude Code settings](/docs/en/settings) instead so configuration is shared between extension and CLI. |
  | Disable Login Prompt | Skip authentication prompts (for third-party provider setups) |
  | Allow Dangerously Skip Permissions | Bypass all permission prompts. **Use with extreme caution**—recommended only for isolated sandboxes with no internet access. |
  | Claude Process Wrapper | Executable path used to launch the Claude process |
- **Claude Code settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`): These settings are shared between the VS Code extension and the CLI. Use this file for allowed commands and directories, environment variables, hooks, and MCP servers. See the [settings documentation](/docs/en/settings) for details.

## [​](#use-third-party-providers) Use third-party providers

By default, Claude Code connects directly to Anthropic’s API. If your organization uses Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry to access Claude, configure the extension to use your provider instead:

1

Disable login prompt

Open the [Disable Login Prompt setting](vscode://settings/claudeCode.disableLoginPrompt) and check the box.You can also open VS Code settings (`Cmd+,` on Mac or `Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux), search for “Claude Code login”, and check **Disable Login Prompt**.

2

Configure your provider

Follow the setup guide for your provider:

- [Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/amazon-bedrock)
- [Claude Code on Google Vertex AI](/docs/en/google-vertex-ai)
- [Claude Code on Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/microsoft-foundry)

These guides cover configuring your provider in `~/.claude/settings.json`, which ensures your settings are shared between the VS Code extension and the CLI.

## [​](#vs-code-extension-vs-claude-code-cli) VS Code extension vs. Claude Code CLI

The extension doesn’t yet have full feature parity with the CLI. If you need CLI-only features, you can run `claude` directly in VS Code’s integrated terminal.

| Feature | CLI | VS Code Extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slash commands | [Full set](/docs/en/slash-commands) | Subset (type `/` to see available) |
| MCP server config | Yes | No (configure via CLI, use in extension) |
| Checkpoints | Yes | Coming soon |
| `!` bash shortcut | Yes | No |
| Tab completion | Yes | No |

### [​](#run-cli-in-vs-code) Run CLI in VS Code

To use the CLI while staying in VS Code, open the integrated terminal (`` Ctrl+` `` on Windows/Linux or `` Cmd+` `` on Mac) and run `claude`. The CLI automatically integrates with your IDE for features like diff viewing and diagnostic sharing.
If using an external terminal, run `/ide` inside Claude Code to connect it to VS Code.

### [​](#switch-between-extension-and-cli) Switch between extension and CLI

The extension and CLI share the same conversation history. To continue an extension conversation in the CLI, run `claude --resume` in the terminal. This opens an interactive picker where you can search for and select your conversation.

## [​](#security-considerations) Security considerations

With auto-edit permissions enabled, Claude Code can modify VS Code configuration files (like `settings.json` or `tasks.json`) that VS Code may execute automatically. This could potentially bypass Claude Code’s normal permission prompts.
To reduce risk when working with untrusted code:

- Enable [VS Code Restricted Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust#_restricted-mode) for untrusted workspaces
- Use manual approval mode instead of auto-accept for edits
- Review changes carefully before accepting them

## [​](#fix-common-issues) Fix common issues

### [​](#extension-won’t-install) Extension won’t install

- Ensure you have a compatible version of VS Code (1.98.0 or later)
- Check that VS Code has permission to install extensions
- Try installing directly from the Marketplace website

### [​](#spark-icon-not-visible) Spark icon not visible

The Spark icon appears in the **Editor Toolbar** (top-right of editor) when you have a file open. If you don’t see it:

1. **Open a file**: The icon requires a file to be open—having just a folder open isn’t enough
2. **Check VS Code version**: Requires 1.98.0 or higher (Help → About)
3. **Restart VS Code**: Run “Developer: Reload Window” from the Command Palette
4. **Disable conflicting extensions**: Temporarily disable other AI extensions (Cline, Continue, etc.)
5. **Check workspace trust**: The extension doesn’t work in Restricted Mode

Alternatively, click ”✱ Claude Code” in the **Status Bar** (bottom-right corner)—this works even without a file open. You can also use the **Command Palette** (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type “Claude Code”.

### [​](#claude-code-never-responds) Claude Code never responds

If Claude Code isn’t responding to your prompts:

1. **Check your internet connection**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection
2. **Start a new conversation**: Try starting a fresh conversation to see if the issue persists
3. **Try the CLI**: Run `claude` from the terminal to see if you get more detailed error messages
4. **File a bug report**: If the problem continues, [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues) with details about the error

### [​](#standalone-cli-not-connecting-to-ide) Standalone CLI not connecting to IDE

- Ensure you’re running Claude Code from VS Code’s integrated terminal (not an external terminal)
- Ensure the CLI for your IDE variant is installed:
  - VS Code: `code` command should be available
  - Cursor: `cursor` command should be available
  - Windsurf: `windsurf` command should be available
  - VSCodium: `codium` command should be available
- If the command isn’t available, install it from the Command Palette → “Shell Command: Install ‘code’ command in PATH”

## [​](#uninstall-the-extension) Uninstall the extension

To uninstall the Claude Code extension:

1. Open the Extensions view (`Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac or `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux)
2. Search for “Claude Code”
3. Click **Uninstall**

To also remove extension data and reset all settings:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.vscode/globalStorage/anthropic.claude-code
```

For additional help, see the [troubleshooting guide](/docs/en/troubleshooting).

## [​](#next-steps) Next steps

Now that you have Claude Code set up in VS Code:

- [Explore common workflows](/docs/en/common-workflows) to get the most out of Claude Code
- [Set up MCP servers](/docs/en/mcp) to extend Claude’s capabilities with external tools. Configure servers using the CLI, then use them in the extension.
- [Configure Claude Code settings](/docs/en/settings) to customize allowed commands, hooks, and more. These settings are shared between the extension and CLI.
