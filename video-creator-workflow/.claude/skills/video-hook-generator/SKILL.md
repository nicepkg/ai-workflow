## Platform-Specific Hooks

### YouTube (Long-form)
```
More time to build curiosity:
- Can use 5-15 second hooks
- Setup + Payoff preview works well
- Credibility establishment helps

Example:
"In 7 years of [expertise], I've never seen anything like this.
What I'm about to show you completely changed how I [do thing],
and by the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to do it too."
```

### YouTube Shorts / TikTok / Reels
```
ULTRA-FAST hooks (1-3 seconds):
- First word/frame must hook
- Text on screen essential
- Visual hook + Audio hook together

Example:
[TEXT ON SCREEN: "The $3 thing that replaced my $300 product"]
[VOICEOVER: "Throw away your expensive [product]"]
[VISUAL: Dramatic product reveal or reaction]
```

### Instagram Reels
```
Slightly more polished feel:
- Aesthetic matters more
- Hook can be visual-first
- Trending audio helps

Example:
[VISUAL: Stunning transformation or result]
[TEXT: "Wait for it..."]
[AUDIO: Trending sound that builds anticipation]
```

## Hook Checklist

Before finalizing your hook, verify:

- [ ] **Specific**: Not generic ("This video will change your life" ❌)
- [ ] **Promises value**: Clear benefit for watching
- [ ] **Creates curiosity**: Unanswered question or teased result
- [ ] **Matches content**: Don't clickbait with unrelated hooks
- [ ] **Platform-appropriate**: Length and style fit the platform
- [ ] **Speakable**: Easy to deliver naturally
- [ ] **Text-overlay ready**: Works with on-screen text

## Common Hook Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too generic | "Hey guys, welcome back" | Start with value/hook |
| Too long | 15-second intro before hook | Hook in first 3 seconds |
| No curiosity | "Today I'll show you X" | Tease the result/surprise |
| Clickbait | Hook unrelated to content | Match hook to delivery |
| Weak opening word | "So, um, today..." | Strong first word |
| No visual hook | Talking head start | Add text/visual element |
