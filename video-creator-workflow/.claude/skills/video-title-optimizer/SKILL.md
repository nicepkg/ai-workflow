## Title Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] **Under character limit**: Visible in search results
- [ ] **Keyword included**: Preferably in first half
- [ ] **Curiosity or value**: Reason to click
- [ ] **Matches content**: Not misleading clickbait
- [ ] **Complements thumbnail**: Doesn't repeat thumbnail text
- [ ] **No all-caps abuse**: 1-2 words max in caps
- [ ] **Specific**: Numbers, timeframes, or details included

## Common Title Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too vague | "My Morning Routine" | "My 5AM Morning Routine That 10X'd My Productivity" |
| Keyword stuffing | "Best Camera Best Budget Camera 2025 Camera Review" | "Best Budget Camera in 2025 (Under $500)" |
| Repeats thumbnail | Title: "SHOCKING!" / Thumb: "SHOCKING!" | Different but complementary |
| No hook | "Photoshop Tutorial" | "Photoshop Tutorial That Took Me 5 Years to Learn" |
| Clickbait mismatch | Title promises X, video delivers Y | Match hook to content |
| Episode numbers first | "EP. 47: The Best Tips" | "The Best Tips (Ep. 47)" or remove |

## Title + Thumbnail Pairing

```
RULE: Title and thumbnail should tell different parts of the same story

✅ Good Pairing:
Title: "I Tried the World's Spiciest Chip"
Thumbnail: [Reaction face + chip image]
(Title = what, Thumbnail = emotional hook)

❌ Bad Pairing:
Title: "SHOCKING RESULTS!!"
Thumbnail: Text saying "SHOCKING RESULTS"
(Redundant - wastes space)

✅ Good Pairing:
Title: "How I Made $10,000 in 30 Days"
Thumbnail: [Money visual + "30 DAYS"]
(Title = full context, Thumbnail = key number emphasis)
```
