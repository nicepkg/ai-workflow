# Writing User Stories

## Overview

Help Claude and subagents write properly formatted user stories for task definition.

**Core principle:** User stories are formulaic ways of expressing user requirements. They identify the perosna of the actor, what they want to do, and what benefit are they hoping to gain from their actions.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- You are asked to write a user story
- You are asked to plan a feature

## User Story Format

As a PERSONA
I want to DESCRIPTION_OF_ACTION
So that DESCRIPTION_OF_BENEFIT.

### Examples

As a non-technical stakeholder, 
I want to understand what changed in a release without reading code diffs 
so that I can communicate updates to customers effectively.

As a new user, 
I want to see examples of AI-generated code before connecting my repository 
so that I understand the value proposition before committing to integration.

As a home cook,
I want to see that recipes have been tested by professional chefs
so that I can know whether they are worth trying.
