# Print notes for QR codes

- Prefer **SVG** for print (crisp at any size).
- Use **error correction H** for:
  - stickers
  - glossy surfaces
  - codes that might get scratched
  - when you add a logo (not supported in this pack yet)
- Minimum practical sizes:
  - phone screen / web: 256–512px PNG
  - print: at least ~1 inch (2.5cm) for simple URLs; larger for distance scanning
- Keep enough “quiet zone” (border). Border 4 is a good default.
- Always test scan on 2–3 different phones before shipping.
