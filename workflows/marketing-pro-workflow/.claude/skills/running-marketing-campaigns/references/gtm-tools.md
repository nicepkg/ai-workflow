## Market Sizing

### TAM, SAM, SOM

| Term | Definition | Calculation |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **TAM** | Total Addressable Market | Industry revenue or (# customers × ACV) |
| **SAM** | Serviceable Available Market | TAM filtered by geography, segment |
| **SOM** | Serviceable Obtainable Market | SAM × realistic market share % |

### Calculation Methods

**Top-Down:**
```
Industry reports → Filter by segment → Apply market share

Example:
Global CRM market: $50B (TAM)
× 40% SMB segment = $20B (SAM)
× 2% realistic share = $400M (SOM)
```

**Bottom-Up (Preferred):**
```
# of customers × Average revenue per customer

Example:
500,000 target companies × 10% addressable = 50,000
× $10,000 ACV = $500M (SAM)
× 5% capture = $25M (SOM)
```
