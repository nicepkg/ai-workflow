## Copywriting Frameworks

### AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

```
ATTENTION: Bold opening that stops the scroll
↓
INTEREST: Expand on the hook with relevant details
↓
DESIRE: Paint the outcome, benefits, transformation
↓
ACTION: Clear, single CTA
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Your competitors are doing this (you're not)

[ATTENTION]
87% of top-performing companies use marketing automation.

[INTEREST]
They're nurturing leads while you sleep, following up instantly,
and converting at 2x the rate.

[DESIRE]
Imagine waking up to qualified leads in your inbox, 
your pipeline growing automatically.

[ACTION]
See how it works → [CTA BUTTON]
```

### PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solve)

```
PROBLEM: State the pain point clearly
↓
AGITATE: Emphasize consequences
↓
SOLVE: Present your solution
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Tired of leads going cold?

[PROBLEM]
You're generating leads, but they're not converting.

[AGITATE]
Every day that passes, those leads forget about you. 
That marketing spend? Wasted.

[SOLVE]
Our automated sequences engage leads within minutes.
Start your free trial → [CTA]
```

### BAB (Before, After, Bridge)

```
BEFORE: Current painful state
↓
AFTER: Desired future state
↓
BRIDGE: How to get there
```

### CTA Best Practices

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Quantity | Single CTA (increases clicks up to 371%) |
| Language | Action-oriented, benefit-focused |
| Button text | "Get my free guide" not "Submit" |
| Placement | Above fold + end of email |

**Strong CTAs:** "Start my free trial", "Get the template", "Reserve my spot"
**Weak CTAs:** "Click here", "Submit", "Learn more"
