# Newsletter Coach - How It Works

## The One-Sentence Version

It's like having a skilled interviewer who pulls the gold out of your daily experiences and shapes it into a newsletter your audience actually wants to read.

## Why This Exists

Here's the problem: You have experiences every single day that would make incredible content. Conversations with clients. Mistakes you caught yourself making. Little moments of clarity. But by the time you sit down to write, they've evaporated.

Or worse - you remember them, but you can't figure out how to turn "I had an interesting call with a client today" into something that actually teaches people something.

This is the extraction problem. The insight is there, buried in the experience. You just need someone to pull it out.

That's what this skill does. It's your writing partner who asks the right questions at the right time, in the right order, until the content practically writes itself.

## The Mental Model: The 7-Stop Journey

Think of writing a newsletter like a road trip. Most people try to jump straight from "I have an idea" to "finished article" - that's like trying to drive from Sydney to Melbourne by just pointing the car south and hoping.

This skill breaks it into seven stops. Each stop has a specific job. You can't skip ahead because each stop gives you what you need for the next one.

**Stop 1: What Actually Happened?**
This is the fact-finding phase. Not "what do you think about X" but "what did you actually do yesterday?" We're looking for the raw material - the actions, decisions, conversations, and mistakes. Think of it like panning for gold. We need the dirt before we can find the nuggets.

**Stop 2: Who Cares?**
Every piece of content needs an audience. Not "everyone" - a specific someone. This stop helps you see who else has the same problem, makes the same mistakes, or could benefit from what you learned. It's like choosing which radio station to broadcast on.

**Stop 3: The Clarity Statement**
This is your content brief - all on one page. What's the topic? Who's it for? What's their problem? What will they get out of reading this? It's the "before you write a single word" checkpoint that saves you from wandering off into the weeds.

**Stop 4: The Headline Factory**
You get 10 headline options using five proven formulas. Not random brainstorming - structured options that have worked for decades. Pick the one that makes you think "yes, that's the article I want to write."

**Stop 5: The Skeleton**
Now we build the outline. Based on your headline, what type of post is this? A how-to? A lessons-learned? A mistakes-to-avoid? Each type has a different structure. You end up with 4-8 subheads that tell the whole story at a glance.

**Stop 6: Putting Meat on the Bones**
Section by section, we fill in the details. This is where those 14 "expansion tools" come in - stories, stats, steps, examples, frameworks. Each subhead gets developed until it's actually useful to the reader.

**Stop 7: The Final Draft**
Everything comes together. Written in your voice, paced for scanning, structured for engagement. Ready to drop into Substack.

## How You Actually Use It

Start a conversation. Say something like:
- "Help me write a newsletter"
- "I want to brainstorm some ideas"
- "Something interesting happened yesterday..."

The skill takes it from there. It'll ask you about your day, drill down on the interesting bits, help you see the lesson hiding inside, and guide you through the whole process.

**The key:** You're not writing alone. You're having a conversation. The content emerges from the back-and-forth.

## What It's NOT

This isn't an AI that writes generic content for you. It's a process that pulls YOUR insights from YOUR experiences.

It won't:
- Make up stories (it uses what you tell it)
- Write in someone else's voice (it's trained on The Little Blue Report style)
- Publish for you (you still copy the final draft to Substack)
- Replace your thinking (it structures and extracts, but the ideas are yours)

Think of it like a great assistant who knows exactly what questions to ask. The magic is in the extraction, not the generation.

## The Coaching Analogy

If you've ever had a good coaching session, you know that moment when someone asks you a question and suddenly you see your own situation clearly for the first time.

"Why did you do it that way?"
"What were you trying to avoid?"
"Who else makes that mistake?"

That's exactly what this skill does - but for content creation. It asks the questions that make your experiences become teachable.

The 7-phase structure is just the container. The real value is in the questions and the extraction process. By the time you reach Phase 7, writing the actual newsletter feels almost automatic because you've already done all the hard thinking.
