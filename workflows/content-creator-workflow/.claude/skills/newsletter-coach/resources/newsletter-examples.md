## Example 1: Technical/Learning Format

### What K-Pop Concerts And Mega Church Productions Taught Us About Running 7-Figure Coaching Events (That Traditional AV Companies Will Never Tell You)

**Subhead:** Or how to have fun and sh*t your pants simultaneously

**Date:** Nov 10, 2025

---

Ten minutes.

That's how long it took Taki Moore to do his sound check at the Million Dollar Coach boardroom intensive in Palm Springs last week.

Ten minutes to test his iPad connection, verify his wireless microphone, and confirm all three camera feeds were capturing perfectly.

For context: our previous sound checks took 90 to 120 minutes. Every single time.

This wasn't because we were slow or incompetent. It was because traditional AV production is a Frankenstein system of specialized gear that barely speaks to each other, held together with exotic cables, adapters, and hope.

I spent the last couple of months researching and testing a completely different approach. Instead of looking at what other coaching companies were doing, I looked at K-pop concert production and mega church broadcasting. Industries that solved the exact problem we face: how to deliver broadcast-quality video production anywhere in the world, consistently, without depending on local crews or waiting weeks for edited content.

The result? A complete 3-camera NDI (Network Device Interface) production system that fits in two Pelican cases, delivers finished files the moment the session ends, and fundamentally changes what's possible for coaching events.

This is brand new intellectual property in the coaching space. Traditional AV companies won't tell you about this because it eliminates most of what they charge for. So I'm going to.

Here are the 8 lessons from testing this system live at a high-stakes coaching intensive:

---

## Lesson #1: The biggest production breakthrough isn't better cameras - it's using network infrastructure that already exists everywhere instead of exotic video cables

Traditional AV production runs on specialized video gear. HDMI cables, SDI cables, proprietary connectors. This gear only exists in the AV world, which means you're dependent on specialty suppliers, local AV companies, and equipment that may or may not be available in Bali or Costa Rica or wherever you're running your next intensive.

The breakthrough we discovered came from asking a different question: What if we stopped using exotic video cables entirely and just used the infrastructure that already exists at every hotel on the planet?

Network infrastructure. Ethernet cables. Routers. Power over Ethernet.

This stuff is everywhere. Every hotel has it. Every conference center has it. Even in exotic locations, Ethernet is far more readily available than specialized video cables. And here's the kicker - a 50-meter high-grade thin Ethernet cable is lighter and easier to carry on a plane than a comparable HDMI cable, which is massive, delicate, and has reliability issues over long runs.

**The Technology That Made It Possible**

NDI was created by Dr. Andrew Cross at NewTek and announced in September 2015 at the International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam. The protocol was designed to solve a specific problem: how to transmit broadcast-quality video over standard IP networks without requiring expensive specialized infrastructure.

Before NDI, high-quality video transmission required either HDMI or SDI cables with all their limitations - physical cable runs, one-directional data flow, and massive compatibility headaches. Dr. Cross and his team created NDI as a royalty-free protocol that would allow "any NDI sources to be adopted by any NDI destination on the network." It was made publicly available in early 2016, and within the first year, over 100,000 devices were developed with NDI support.

The genius of NDI is that it uses standard Ethernet to send broadcast-quality video at low latency with frame-accurate switching. Power over Ethernet means you can power cameras with the same cable carrying the video signal. One cable. That's it. Plus, because it's bidirectional (unlike traditional video cables), you get remote control functionality and tally lights built in.

K-pop production crews figured this out years ago. Mega churches running multi-campus broadcasts figured it out. They needed systems that were portable, reliable, and didn't require a small army of technicians. Now that same technology is available for coaching events, most people in this space just don't know it exists yet.

## Lesson #2: A professional 3-camera production system can now fit in two Pelican cases you can check and carry on a plane

When we set out to build this system, one of our core requirements was simple: it had to be something one person could carry on a plane without paying for extra baggage or coordinating freight shipments.

Traditional multi-camera setups are a logistics nightmare. You're talking multiple road cases, specialized flight cases, potentially hundreds of pounds of gear that needs to be shipped ahead of time or requires a full production crew just to transport it. For international events, you're dealing with customs, carnets, the risk of gear getting lost or damaged in transit.

Our entire 3-camera NDI production system fits in two Pelican Air cases. A Pelican Air 1535 (the largest international carry-on size) and a Pelican Air 1615 (the largest check-in size that moves easily through baggage carousels). Between those two cases, you've got everything you need to run a professional multi-camera shoot.

You can walk onto a plane as a single operator with a complete production studio. No freight shipping. No coordination with local rental houses. No hoping that the gear you ordered actually shows up at the hotel.

**Here's the real genius: we built redundancy into the carry-on case.**

The 1535 contains a minimum viable production system. One BirdDog X1 camera, wireless microphones, the RODECaster Video switcher, all necessary cables, and an iPhone tripod. If your checked bag goes missing (and it does happen), you can still run a single-camera production the moment you land. An iPhone with the RODE app becomes an NDI camera - and honestly, modern iPhones are brilliant cameras.

The 1615 checked case carries your full production capability: the BirdDog KBD camera controller, two additional BirdDog cameras, the Ethernet router that handles all the Power over Ethernet, and a wireless PoE hub that creates a private wireless network for the entire system.

The freedom this creates is massive. You're not bound by shipping schedules or freight costs. You can pivot on short notice. If an opportunity comes up to shoot an event next week in another country, you're not scrambling to figure out gear logistics. You just pack your cases and go.

## Lesson #3: Sound checks dropped from 90 minutes to 10 minutes the moment we stopped depending on compatibility between different specialized gear

For years, sound checks at our events were a 90 to 120 minute ordeal. We'd be running cable tests, checking signal flows, troubleshooting compatibility issues between different pieces of gear, adjusting audio levels, making sure cameras were communicating with the switcher, confirming that everything was recording properly.

It wasn't that we were slow. It was that traditional AV setups are Frankenstein systems - a bunch of different manufacturers' gear all trying to talk to each other through different protocols and connection types. Add to that the reality of setting up in exotic locations with language barriers and wildly varying technical capabilities from local crews, and you've got a recipe for extended troubleshooting sessions every single time.

**The two things that consistently ate the most time:**

First, Taki likes to roam with his iPad while presenting. Getting that iPad feed to reliably show through projectors, especially when routing through separate video distributors, was endlessly tricky. Different networks, different protocols, constant troubleshooting.

Second, audio routing was a nightmare. We needed audio from the hotel's PA system to sync with our recording and production units. Then we needed that to work with Zoom for hybrid events. Then it all had to integrate with our old ATEM-based systems. Separate cable runs from the stage for HDMI and audio introduced complexity and latency. Multiple audio feeds, each one a potential point of failure. We were constantly hunting down where signals were breaking down.

At the Palm Springs intensive, we did something we'd never done before. Taki came in for his sound check. He used AirPlay to send his iPad feed to an Apple TV connected to our Ethernet network. The Apple TV connected via HDMI to the RODECaster Video.

Ten minutes. Done.

Here's what changed: AirPlay carries both video and audio. HDMI carries both video and audio. One cable from the Apple TV to the RODECaster Video, and we had complete control over both Taki's screen and his audio in the production mix. Because the Apple TV was on our own portable WiFi base station (powered via PoE), we weren't competing with hotel WiFi signals or fighting with router and security protocols in the hotel network. Latency dropped to the point where it felt ultrasmooth for Taki with a crystal clear signal.

Presenters with Macs simply AirPlayed to the Apple TV. No separate cable runs from the stage. No hunting down audio sync issues. No complex signal routing.

We had backup solutions ready - ASK nook HDMI transmitters and receivers, even a PoE USB-C adapter to run feeds via NDI protocol - we didn't need them. (Though as you'll see, we definitely needed backup solutions in other areas.)

The entire system speaks one language. NDI over Ethernet. The RODECaster Video sees every NDI source on the network automatically. The cameras power up and appear. All audio and video sources are controlled through one system. We provide one clean HDMI feed and one audio sync feed to the house system for their projector and speakers. Everything else - recording, streaming, switching - is handled internally through our unified system.

We'd pre-tested the system back home because it's all network-based. Unlike traditional setups where you need to physically connect everything in the actual venue to test it, we could verify that our cameras, switcher, and audio system all played nicely together before we ever left for Palm Springs. Of course, pre-testing can only take you so far - there are some things you simply can't anticipate until you're in a live environment with real pressure, which we learned the hard way with our audio solution.

When everything runs on standardized network infrastructure, compatibility stops being a variable. It just works.

## Lesson #4: Ethernet cables are lighter, cheaper, more reliable, and available at every hotel on the planet - even boutique properties in the Costa Rican jungle

There's a reason why we built this entire system around Ethernet infrastructure, and it's not just about the NDI protocol. It's about the physical reality of traveling with production gear to exotic locations around the world.

Traditional video production requires specialized cables. HDMI cables for modern digital signals. SDI cables for broadcast-quality video. These cables are expensive, heavy, and fragile. A 50-meter HDMI cable is massive, requires careful coiling to avoid damage, and has signal reliability issues over long runs in large ballrooms. You need repeaters, signal boosters, and backup cables because long HDMI runs are notoriously unreliable.

Now consider Ethernet. A 50-meter high-grade thin Ethernet cable weighs a fraction of an equivalent HDMI cable. It coils easily. It's robust. And here's the beautiful part - you can buy Ethernet cables almost anywhere in the world. Even in exotic locations, boutique hotels in the middle of the Costa Rican jungle, Ethernet infrastructure exists. Hotels have it. Conference centers have it. It's the backbone of modern connectivity everywhere.

Cost is another factor. Specialized video cables are expensive and require specific lengths for specific runs. Ethernet cables are commodity items. If you need a different length or a cable fails, you can source a replacement locally without scrambling to find a specialty AV supplier who may or may not exist in your location.

Power over Ethernet adds another layer of elegance. One cable delivers both power and data to your cameras. Traditional setups require separate power runs, separate video cables, often separate control cables for PTZ functionality. We're talking about cable management nightmares, especially in large venues. With PoE, it's one cable per camera. Clean, simple, reliable.

**Here's the strategic piece that matters for coaching businesses:**

Look, you can just pay for traditional AV if your budget allows for it. Many 7 and 8-figure coaching companies do. With content becoming the key differentiator in both marketing and delivery, this infrastructure allows you to elevate your content quality regardless of where you are on that spectrum.

For established companies that can already afford full AV crews, this system maintains consistent quality across every event worldwide without the variability of local crews. For coaching companies on the way up, you get professional multi-camera capture, faster editing turnaround, and broadcast-quality output for a fraction of what traditional production costs.

And because NDI and PoE work over standard network infrastructure, your options multiply. iPhones become viable cameras - both as main cameras and backup solutions. Modern iPhones with the RODE app deliver NDI feeds that are indistinguishable from dedicated cameras in most lighting conditions. Suddenly you have flexibility that traditional setups simply can't match.

When you're setting up in a ballroom in Bali or a conference center in Buenos Aires, the ability to use standardized, readily available infrastructure instead of specialized gear you had to pack and transport changes everything. You're not dependent on finding the right adapter or the right cable length from a local supplier who may not speak your language. You're working with the same infrastructure that powers the hotel's internet - and they definitely have that figured out.

## Lesson #5: The gear working at home and the gear working under live event pressure are two completely different things

We spent weeks testing this system. We ran it in the office. We did a small trial at an event in Colorado with one PTZ camera. We verified that every component worked, that the cameras connected, that audio flowed properly, that the RODECaster Video could see all the NDI sources. Everything checked out.

Then we went live at the Million Dollar Coach boardroom intensive in Palm Springs.

And we discovered that "the gear works" and "I can operate this gear smoothly during a live event" are two entirely different things.

The technical setup was fine. The cameras connected. The NDI feeds came through. The Ethernet infrastructure performed flawlessly. We had a two-stage setup - a main stage for speakers and projectors, and an acoustic stage at the back of the room. We had a WWE-style entrance with music cues that needed to hit at precisely the right moment. We had camera switches that needed to happen in real-time as the action moved around the room.

Testing at home can tell you if your cameras work. It can't simulate the pressure of switching between three camera angles while also cueing entrance music while also monitoring audio levels while also making sure you're capturing the right shots - all with 100 people in the room and your client expecting professional-quality production.

**The audio choreography taught us just as much as the video.**

We used an iPhone on Bluetooth for music, which worked beautifully in testing. Under live pressure though, there's human delay. Taki is an amazing presenter who gives excellent cues to the AV team. When he signals for "think" music while you're setting up a shot on a BirdDog camera, you need to switch contexts - find the phone, select the right track, hit play. Those seconds matter.

In the debrief, we realized the solution: pre-load our "think" music and "hype" music cues directly onto the RODECaster Duo's pads. One button press. No context switching. Those precious seconds add up to much more responsive production.

The RODECaster Duo proved its worth for exactly this reason. Physical faders and mute buttons are invaluable when you're operating under pressure. You can feel the controls without looking, make adjustments by touch while your eyes stay on the stage. Digital interfaces on a screen can't match that tactile feedback when things are moving fast.

The choreography of operating a live production is something you can only learn by doing it. Which button switches to which camera. How fast you can punch between sources without the output looking choppy. When to use the safety camera so you can adjust other shots. Which pad has which music cue loaded. How to ride the audio faders while managing camera switches.

We had planned to use the BirdDog KBD controller board for PTZ camera control, which would have made the camera choreography much smoother. We couldn't get it working on the day - it needed a factory reset - so we operated without it. That meant more manual switching, more cognitive load, more opportunities to miss a shot.

The lesson isn't that testing doesn't matter. It absolutely does. Testing proves your gear functions. Live events teach you how to operate that gear under pressure. Those are two different skill sets, and you can only develop the second one by going live.

## Lesson #6: Wireless receivers will fail at the worst possible moment - you need fail-safes, backup plans, and pre-event testing protocols built into your setup

No matter how well you plan, no matter how thoroughly you test, wireless technology will find a way to fail when it matters most. This isn't pessimism. It's physics and Murphy's Law having a conversation.

The RODE Wireless infrastructure operates on the 2.4GHz spectrum, the same frequency as older WiFi networks. When you're in a ballroom with hundreds of incredibly successful coaches attending (many of whom run their own events), each with their phones, hotspots, tablets, and various wireless devices, you're operating in a congested RF environment. It creates challenges you simply can't replicate in pre-testing.

At the Palm Springs intensive, we ran into an audio issue that we should have caught earlier. We had two RODE Wireless systems going into the RODECaster Duo and two RODECaster Wireless Pro systems going into the RODECaster Video, giving us four wireless channels total. During one of the sessions, we started getting interference or dropouts on the external audio feed.

Here's where we made the mistake: we didn't test during the session break. We were focused on other priorities, and we assumed that since it had been working, it would continue working. Wrong assumption. By the time we noticed the issue, we were in the middle of a session with paying clients in the room. Remember: assume makes an ass out of u and me.

We suspect the problem was related to the PA system in the venue, possibly some interaction between our wireless frequencies and the hotel's audio infrastructure. After the first session, we made modifications. We separated the WiFi gear at the AV desk. We used the receiver units of the RODE systems and connected them into the Duo via USB. By the end of the event, we had everything dialed in.

**Then we had the real crisis.**

One of our key speakers had a significant wireless microphone issue. We had to swap out multiple microphones to get one that worked. Not just one backup. Multiple backups. We went through every option we had.

The good news? We had multiple backup options and we used ALL of them. Here's what saved us: the RODE Wireless Pro records backup audio on the transmitter itself using 32-bit float recording. Praise all things holy - it recorded the audio beautifully.

So while it was agony for the AV team, frantically swapping microphones during a live presentation, we literally had a beautiful corrected version of the presentation ready for the speaker within a couple of hours. This speaker had planned on using this presentation on their YouTube channel, so the stakes were high. The 32-bit float backup recording was a lifesaver.

**The lessons:**

Make sure we do tests in-room between sessions with all of the audio and cameras. The AV crew does not have the luxury of breaks when we're doing audio and stage changes between sessions. This was a complex setup with multiple stages, and that's what we do at Million Dollar Coach - we test things so we can pass on what works and what doesn't to our clients.

We'll also look at a wireless system to use for main mics as a backup that works out of spectrum, so we're not competing with the 2.4GHz congestion.

The RODE system sounds incredible. Its backup recording system is a lifesaver and its simple integration is remarkable. It just has its limits, and we need to be cognizant of this for our larger events. The RODECaster Duo's limited inputs mean we need to be strategic about routing, which is why having someone dedicated to audio and someone dedicated to video makes sense for most events.

The reality of live production is that you're operating in an RF environment you don't fully control. Hotels have WiFi networks, security systems, other events happening in adjacent rooms, all potentially creating interference. Wireless microphones that work perfectly in your office might struggle in a ballroom with dozens of active devices competing for spectrum.

The gear will fail. The question isn't if, it's when. Your job is to build enough redundancy and testing protocols that when something does fail, you have a backup solution ready to go and the audience never knows there was a problem.

---

## Lesson #7: Once the system works, the real challenge is building the operating protocols - pre-programmed audio cues, stored camera shots, and clear mute/unmute procedures

Getting the gear to work is one challenge. Building repeatable operational protocols that make your production smooth under pressure is another challenge entirely.

After the Palm Springs intensive, our debrief sessions revealed something important: the system performed well, the gear worked reliably (once we sorted the wireless issues), and we captured great content. What needed refinement wasn't the technology - it was our operating procedures.

**Pre-programmed audio cues are essential.**

We used an iPhone on Bluetooth for music during the event, which worked fine technically. The problem was operational. When you're setting up a camera shot and Taki signals for "think" music, you're context-switching. Find the phone. Select the track. Hit play. Those seconds add up, and more importantly, they pull your attention away from the visual production.

The solution: pre-load all our standard music cues directly onto the RODECaster Duo's pad groups. Pad Group 1 for "think" music variations. Pad Group 2 for "hype" music. Pad Group 3 for WWE entrance tracks. One button press, instant response, no context switching. Your hands stay on the production controls, your eyes stay on the stage.

**Stored camera shots eliminate decision fatigue.**

PTZ cameras allow you to program preset shots - specific camera angles, zoom levels, and framing that you can recall instantly. Instead of manually adjusting pan, tilt, and zoom every time you want a particular shot, you hit one button and the camera moves to your pre-programmed position.

We kept the shots simple at Palm Springs. With the physical BirdDog KBD unit down, we had to use software to control the PTZ cameras. It works, it's not ideal. You can control PTZ functions in the RODECaster Video, which is cool, however if you're setting up a shot and then something happens on stage that you need to capture immediately, you have to fix it on the fly. A physical controller separate from the RODECaster Video would be optimal - you're not pulling focus from your switching duties to adjust camera positions.

For a two-stage setup like we had in Palm Springs - main stage for speakers and acoustic stage at the back of the room - stored shots become crucial. You're not thinking "okay, I need to pan left 30 degrees and zoom in slightly." You're thinking "shot three" and the camera goes there. This frees up cognitive bandwidth for everything else you're managing.

**Set up backup cameras before you start recording.**

We didn't need the iPhone backup camera at Palm Springs, which was great. When I was testing during a session break, I couldn't add in the iPhone feed mid-production. Good to know for future events - have your backup solutions fully configured and ready before you hit record, even if you don't plan to use them.

**Mute/unmute protocols matter more than you'd think.**

Taki is comfortable turning his microphone on and off himself, which is great. Not every speaker is. We realized we need clear protocols: who controls muting, when it happens, and what the backup plan is if someone forgets to unmute before speaking.

For future events, having the operator handle muting via the RODECaster's physical controls is probably the better approach. It removes variables. The speaker focuses on presenting, the operator manages audio states. Clear responsibility, no confusion.

**Division of labor becomes necessary at scale.**

The venue's AV company actually had two operators monitoring their gear. I taught them our system and they were able to assist, which was fantastic. Having the AV crew really understand your presenter and the content you're creating is a real advantage. They anticipate needs, they know when important moments are coming, they're part of the production team rather than just technical support.

With one person managing video switching, camera positioning, and audio mixing simultaneously, you're maxing out cognitive capacity. Having a second operator - one focused on audio, one on video - isn't just helpful, it's essential for maintaining quality under pressure.

The audio operator handles music cues, speaker levels, mute states, and monitoring the mix. The video operator manages camera switching, shot selection, and visual storytelling. Both can focus on doing their job well instead of one person trying to do both adequately.

This is why we chose the RODECaster Duo despite its limited inputs. Physical faders and mute buttons that you can operate by feel without looking are worth more than additional inputs when you're managing a live production. Tactile feedback matters under pressure.

The technology enables the production. The protocols make it smooth. Once your gear works reliably, invest your energy in building operating procedures that reduce cognitive load, eliminate decision points, and let your team execute without thinking.

## Lesson #8: K-pop concerts figured out years ago that NDI over Ethernet solves portability, consistency, and speed - coaching events are just catching up

When I started researching solutions for high-quality, portable video production, I didn't look at what other coaching companies were doing. I looked at industries that had already solved the problem at massive scale.

K-pop concerts tour globally with productions that make most corporate events look like amateur hour. Multiple camera angles, broadcast-quality switching, lighting cues synchronized to music, all executed flawlessly night after night in different venues across different countries. The production crews aren't reinventing the system in each city. They're deploying proven infrastructure that works the same way whether they're in Seoul, Los Angeles, or São Paulo.

Mega churches face a similar challenge. Multi-campus operations where the Sunday sermon in the main sanctuary needs to be broadcast live to satellite locations across the city, state, or even internationally. Different venues, different local tech capabilities, different languages spoken by local crews. They need systems that just work, every single time, without extensive on-site troubleshooting.

Both industries figured out that NDI over Ethernet was the answer years before it occurred to most people in the coaching and corporate events space.

Why? Because they were solving for the exact same constraints we face:

**Portability.** You can't ship 500 pounds of gear to every tour stop or satellite campus. You need systems that pack efficiently, travel reliably, and deploy quickly.

**Consistency.** When your brand depends on production quality, you can't accept "whatever the local AV company has available." You need your own gear that performs identically everywhere.

**Speed.** Tour schedules and church service timing don't allow for 2-hour sound checks and weeks of post-production. You need systems that set up fast and deliver content immediately.

The coaching industry is just now catching up to what the entertainment and broadcast world already knows: traditional AV production with specialized cables and format-specific gear is obsolete for mobile, high-quality production. Network infrastructure is the future because network infrastructure is already everywhere.

This isn't bleeding-edge experimental technology. NDI has been around since 2015. Major manufacturers have been building NDI-compatible gear for years. K-pop tours have been using it. Mega churches have been using it. Sports broadcasting has been using it. The NFL uses multiple NDI camera sources to capture every angle of the field.

The coaching space is simply behind the curve. Most 7 and 8-figure coaching businesses are still hiring local AV crews, dealing with inconsistent quality, accepting whatever gear the venue has available, and waiting weeks for edited content. They're operating like it's 2010.

I had to jump in late in the game for this Palm Springs event and design a system that would work now - and why not future-proof it as well? As a senior coach at Million Dollar Coach with a passion for AV production, having presented and produced events for decades, it's extraordinary what opportunities are available with this technology.

**Here's the game changer beyond just production quality:**

We were able to have the recorded sessions fully edited and available within hours. Our clients could be back at the hotel reviewing sessions from the same day. When members can't attend the live event, having access to recordings this quickly minimizes FOMO and, more importantly, allows for increased retention of information when you can review it so soon after experiencing it live.

Given my primary purpose here at The Little Blue Report is to look at AI in the context of expanding a coaching business, I'm really intrigued by what having access to transcripts of these events allows us to do. Like creating support AI power-ups to help with implementation coming out of the event.

I could easily see a time where not only do we have a recording - we have implementation AI tools and power-ups custom created from the session content itself. How cool will that be?

Our role at Million Dollar Coach is to be at the forefront of what's possible in the coaching space. Our job is to test new technologies, figure out what works, and pass those insights to our clients. If we wait for the coaching industry to figure this out organically, our clients lose years of competitive advantage.

Content is becoming the key differentiator for coaching businesses. Your marketing depends on it. Your client experience depends on it. Your ability to scale your message depends on it. The companies that figure out how to produce broadcast-quality content consistently, globally, at speed - and then leverage AI to turn that content into implementation tools - will dominate their markets.

The technology already exists. K-pop figured it out. Mega churches figured it out. Now coaching businesses can too.

## The Bottom Line

Traditional AV production for coaching events is dead, it just doesn't know it yet.

The system we tested at Palm Springs - three BirdDog X1 PTZ cameras, RODECaster Video, RODECaster Duo, all running on NDI over Ethernet infrastructure, packed into two Pelican Air cases - represents a fundamental shift in what's possible.

You can walk onto a plane with broadcast-quality production capability. You can set up in any venue worldwide using infrastructure that already exists. You can deliver finished content within hours instead of weeks. And you can do all of this without depending on local crews, language barriers, or hoping the right gear shows up.

This isn't theory. We did it. Live. At a high-stakes coaching intensive with paying clients in the room.

Yes, there were challenges. Wireless issues we had to troubleshoot. Operating procedures we needed to refine. Backup systems we needed to deploy. That's what first implementations teach you.

The core system works. The technology is proven. K-pop tours and mega churches have been using it for years.

The coaching industry is just now catching up.

The question isn't whether this approach will become standard. It will. The question is whether you'll adopt it now and gain years of competitive advantage, or wait until everyone else figures it out and you're scrambling to catch up.

Content is the differentiator. Production quality matters. Speed to delivery matters. Consistency across global events matters.

This system solves all of it.

## Example 2: Revelation/Insight Format

### I've Transcribed 300+ Coaching Sessions With AI This Year For Notes, And Never Asked The Two Questions That Changed Everything

**Subhead:** Strap in Gang, This is a Journey

**Date:** Nov 02, 2025

### I've been recording and transcribing every coaching session for months, using AI to create summaries and action items for my clients

I discovered MacWhisper about six months ago and it changed my coaching workflow overnight.

See, I record every coaching session. Always have. Zoom's transcription takes forever, and tools like Fathom feel intrusive in the call itself. MacWhisper gives me an almost instant transcript the moment the session ends.

The reason I started doing this was simple: I'm a senior coach at Blackbelt, working with Taki Moore's business coaching clients. My fellow coaches need to know what's happening with each client. I need a record for myself. And honestly, my own note-taking during calls was terrible - I'd either miss half the conversation while scribbling, or I'd send rambling voice memos to my VA to transcribe later.

So I built a system.

Session ends. MacWhisper transcribes it. I feed the transcript to Claude with a prompt I've refined over months. Out comes a summary that includes:

- What we discussed
- Trainings assigned
- Blackbelt concepts we covered (things like "right next thing," the triangle model, the five ones)
- Action items for the client

I don't send these to my own coaching clients - many of them are already using their own AI tools anyway, and they've always got the recording if they need it. For me and the Blackbelt coaching team though? Game changer.

Are they perfect? No. I almost always tweak them. Getting that 80% done automatically is so much better than starting from scratch. And in the very near future, this will all be automated with an agentic workflow.

Here's what I didn't realize: I was using AI brilliantly for admin, and completely missing the bigger opportunity.

### My partner AnnMarie listened to a few calls and said "these all sound really similar" - which got me thinking about patterns I couldn't see

I'm up in Queensland now, and one of the unexpected benefits is that I can do my morning coaching calls outside. In Melbourne, I'd die of exposure trying that. Here, I sit outside with my headphones on, talking to Blackbelt clients while the sun comes up.

AnnMarie's usually doing her own work or walking past, and she overhears my side of these conversations.

One morning she mentioned casually: "You know, these calls all sound really similar."

I was immediately curious. Not defensive - just intrigued.

I probably would have guessed that if someone asked me directly, though I'd never actually thought about it. The more I sat with her observation, the more questions emerged.

What patterns was she hearing that I couldn't see from inside the conversations?

Here's the thing about AnnMarie - she's way further along the inner work path than I am. Over the last couple of years, I've been diving deep into this work myself. And one principle I've come to believe (and yes, it's an experiment, a lens I choose to use): if I'm saying something repeatedly, I should get really curious about what that might be revealing.

Not just for my clients.

For me.

If these coaching sessions all sound similar, what am I teaching over and over? And more importantly - why? What's the universe showing me through these repeated conversations?

That curiosity sat with me for weeks.

### I was going through the Blackbelt launchpad myself (practicing what I preach) and realized I needed article ideas for my newsletter

Some events over the past couple of months made it crystal clear: it was time to get serious about building my own business.

Time to get back to the Little Blue Report newsletter. Time to focus on my AI30DC YouTube channel. Time to stop just coaching others through their launches and actually do my own.

The Blackbelt launchpad is all about understanding your market and building your program model - the foundational building blocks of a coaching business. I've guided dozens of coaches through this process. I've watched Taki and other Blackbelt members build successful businesses, many with smaller YouTube audiences than I have.

Twenty years ago, I was big time. Then I made and lost a couple of fortunes and thought I'd retired. This AI revolution though - like the Mafia - has dragged me back in. Now it's time to fix the leaky taps.

AnnMarie's observation about my repetitive coaching conversations gave me the first insight: if I'm saying the same things over and over in client sessions, maybe I should take a leaf out of my own book. Maybe those repeated patterns ARE my market. Maybe that's what I should be writing about.

I wrote about this realization in last week's newsletter - a cool little validation of the experiment: if the universe keeps showing you something repeatedly, pay attention.

I'd set myself a goal: four weeks in a row of newsletters. You're reading number four right now. And I want to make money from this. These Hello Kitty collectables won't pay for themselves.

I needed article ideas though. Real ones. Not generic "here's what AI can do" content. Ideas rooted in my actual expertise.

That's when I thought about the transcripts.

---

### I uploaded four client session transcripts to Claude and asked it to find themes for potential articles

Actually, it wasn't on a whim at all.

I'd been reading Nicolas Cole's "Write with AI" newsletter, and he'd just published an article about using AI as a brainstorming partner to generate content ideas. The process was brilliant: you tell Claude what you worked on recently, it drills down with "why" and "how" questions, extracts insights, and helps you see what's worth writing about.

The whole article was about jamming on what you'd experienced - turning your daily work into educational content.

**If you want to use this exact process yourself, I highly recommend subscribing to Nicolas Cole's Write with AI newsletter - he provides the complete prompts and Claude Project setup that I used.**

I'd been seeing these clear signs pointing me in the right direction. AnnMarie's comment about my calls sounding similar. Going through the launchpad myself. Needing article ideas for four consecutive weeks of newsletters.

So I thought: what if I just gave Claude my actual session transcripts instead of talking about what happened?

I had four coaching calls scheduled yesterday - velocity calls with Blackbelt members. All recorded. All transcribed with MacWhisper.

No cherry-picking. Just the four sessions from yesterday.

I used Nicolas Cole's exact prompts and project setup. Instead of typing out "Recently I've...", I uploaded the four transcripts and said: "Here are the key conversations I had yesterday. Let's start here."

I was excited. The signs had been pointing this direction. If every interaction is for my benefit, then these transcripts should reveal something.

That's when gold was struck.

---

### Within minutes, AI identified eight distinct patterns I teach repeatedly - frameworks about audience targeting, simplification, marketing to frustrations - things I didn't realize I was saying the same way every time

I thought it was freaking cool.

Claude came back with eight distinct patterns from those four calls:

1. The "Five Ones" concept (one market, one product, one traffic method, one conversion process)
2. Marketing to frustrations vs. fears
3. Working backwards from conversion events
4. Staging promises and outcomes (showing momentum, not promising the end result in 60 days)
5. Training redundancy (why training just one person is dangerous)
6. Unifying multiple programs into one sales process
7. The right audience problem (daily content needs to attract the right people)
8. Podcasts as lead magnets (terrible for direct response, great as private mini-series)

Now, these aren't MY frameworks. They're Blackbelt frameworks. Concepts we reference from other creators. Things I teach coaches every day.

Here's what made me thrilled though: the way I teach them, the examples I use, the context I provide in real coaching situations - THAT creates unique content.

And any one of the people I coach - or anyone reading this newsletter - could use this exact same process to build a unique, bingeable body of work. Which is vital in this day and age.

You don't need to invent new frameworks. You need to extract how YOU teach existing ones.

Numbers seven and two hit hardest - the right audience problem and marketing to frustrations. Those were the ones I really needed to double down on. The others were all relevant and in progress in some way, shape, or form.

As you can see from the start of this very session, we began fleshing out the podcast concept. I do love a good podcast, after all. It would have been an awesome article.

Then Claude asked me a question during our brainstorming that prompted a discussion about my views on every interaction being for my benefit. Claude got quite excited. So did I.

And we pivoted to this.

---

### That's when it hit me: I'm the plumber with leaky taps, using AI for admin but never for strategy

I'm looking at those eight patterns Claude extracted, and then Claude mentions something about using AI for admin tasks - summaries, notes, action items.

That's when it hit me.

I'd been transcribing hundreds of coaching sessions. Using AI brilliantly for admin. Getting those 80% done summaries that made my life easier.

I could be using the exact same transcripts to create really unique content AND reflect back opportunities for my own insight and growth though.

I'm the plumber with leaky taps.

This was such an awesome moment that I have to pack right now to go to Palm Springs to work with our million-dollar-plus Boardroom members and I can't tear myself away from what we're uncovering here.

I see a lot of coaches using AI for admin and that's cool. What if, for very little extra effort, you could use it for strategy as well?

"Writing is thinking." (I believe that's a quote, though I can't recall who said it first.)

Every person who coaches and works with clients in any context - even in teams and work environments - is sitting on a treasure trove of strategic content.

It's damn cool.

---

### The two questions that changed everything: "What content patterns exist across my sessions?" and "What are these sessions telling ME about my own journey?"

Here are the two questions that transformed how I think about my coaching transcripts:

**Question 1: What content patterns exist across my sessions?**

This is the practical one. The content creation engine. You're looking for the frameworks you teach, the problems you solve repeatedly, the language you use naturally.

I'm using this exact process for the article you're reading right now. Upload transcripts to Claude in a dedicated Project (with custom instructions and the prompts I'll share at the end), and let it extract the patterns.

This creates a bingeable body of work that's authentic because it comes from your actual expertise in action, not from staring at a blank page wondering what to write.

**Question 2: What are these sessions telling ME about my own journey?**

This is the one that might sound strange if you haven't explored inner work.

Here's what I've come to believe after three years of pretty intense inner work: every interaction you have is showing you something about yourself. Not in some mystical way - think of it like this: your clients' challenges often reflect challenges you're working through yourself. The problems you're most passionate about solving for others are often the ones you most need to solve for yourself.

With my physics background, it makes sense. Everything is waves and photons interpreted by your brain. What we perceive "out there" is an interpretation created by our consciousness.

You don't have to believe any of that though.

Just try it as an experiment: What are the common elements across your coaching sessions that might be relevant to YOUR journey right now?

You might be surprised. I used to be surprised. Now I just accept it. It makes sessions more fun and it's an interesting way to look at life.

This is one of the most practical benefits and observations from years of inner work.

And here's the thing - I started this whole process as an opportunity to mine content for my newsletter. It became something more through working with AI. Which is exactly the point: using AI for both the practical AND the strategic.

---

### The first question is practical - extract your expertise, find your frameworks, never run out of authentic content ideas again

Here's the workflow: Record session. Transcribe it. (I use MacWhisper because it's local on my computer and very fast, though any transcription tool works.) Upload to a Claude Project with custom instructions. Ask for patterns.

How often? Match it to your publishing schedule. The Little Blue Report is once a week, so I had a four-session day and just used that. It would be interesting to ask for themes over a month or even a week - more sessions would reveal even more patterns.

Now here's the awesome part: this content is all my own thinking and words, cleaned up. It's the opposite of AI "slop."

There's no way you could "one-shot" an article of this caliber. I've probably spent two to three CFTs (Critical Focus Time - 50-minute blocks) on this process. Compared to my vomit draft approach - which I've been doing for twenty years - this has extracted much more interesting content and ideas. The overall time investment will be similar, and the enjoyment of the process is 10x better.

And as you can tell from this article, it's me. It's my voice. I wrote most of it. Just fewer typos.

This isn't a speed process. It's a strategic thinking process. There's room for both - I still do 10-minute freewriting to warm up.

The strategic partnership with AI though? That's where the magic happens.

I think all types of content could be generated from here. Newsletter articles like this one. Social posts. Course content. Lead magnets. I'm excited to apply this process to my YouTube videos, and I'm starting daily Instagram content soon - something I'm not looking forward to. I'll be leaning heavily into AI-generated work, instead of generic stuff though, it'll be based on strategic thinking using a variation of this prompt and project style.

I'm constantly working with coaches who don't know what to write about. If I got this many interesting ideas from four sessions, and you're mining what you do on a daily basis plus sessions and conversations with your market - how are you going to run out of ideas?

And when the creation process is this fun? That removes a major barrier.

I've done this over multiple sessions, in different continents, and I couldn't wait to get back to writing to see what else would pop. That's unusual. And pretty awesome.

Do you need to do this with every session? I don't think so. I started with four and that was more than enough to produce all these ideas. Three would be a minimum - part of the fun is seeing what's common across disparate sessions.

---

### The second question is the one I've been experimenting with through my inner work: what if every coaching session is also a mirror showing you what you need to work on?

This is where it gets awesome and a little freaky, and I really encourage you to have an open mind and look at this as an interesting experiment.

For now, you could do what I did - just upload some sessions and see what happens.

If I were designing a dedicated process for this though, I'd create it as a separate Claude Project with specific context. Who you are. What you do for work. Who you coach (newsflash: that's a big tell). What you're working on. Any influences from coaching and inner work. Goals, plans, projects - anything that will help the AI look for patterns that are relevant to YOU.

I don't think we need to feed it a particular inner work framework. LLMs work on patterns and probability. Let's lean into that and let it come up with what it observes as patterns in the context of your coaching sessions.

Use an LLM with a large context window. (A context window is how much information an AI can "remember" and process at once - think of it like working memory. Claude has a 200,000 token context window, which means it can analyze multiple lengthy transcripts simultaneously and spot patterns across all of them.)

Here's the prompt I'd suggest:

_"I'm trying an interesting experiment exploring a theory that in each session I conduct, there's something of benefit to me. Here are X sessions from the last Y days. Can you look for interesting patterns that may be reflected in these sessions - in particular recurring themes - that could be the basis for me expanding my business and inner work?"_

Then add the transcripts and see what pops for you.

For me, the content creation and simplification patterns really were mirrors being held up. Which led to this whole process. Which is awesome.

**Why This Makes You A Better Coach**

This makes me a better coach in a couple of key ways: My interest in sessions is significantly increased. I'm open and focused on the client, curious to see what in this session is a reflection for me to ponder.

It's natural in coaching to deal with similar issues repeatedly - that's part of the game.

Here's the REALLY interesting thing, and this is where the gold lives:

Pay attention to the ones you react negatively to. The ones where you feel frustration, irritation, that edge of judgment.

"What's so hard about getting coaches to do five pieces of content? Sheesh!"

I would say this. A lot.

Horrifyingly (initially), these were exactly the things I really should have brought my attention to.

Ed, meet mirror.

The plumber with leaky taps wasn't just about content extraction. It was about everything I was coaching others to do that I wasn't doing myself.

This is a really interesting project, and one I'll be developing further.

---

## Conclusion: The Plumber Is Starting To Fix His Own Damn Taps

So here's what I learned from uploading four coaching transcripts:

I was using AI brilliantly for admin, competently for summaries, and not at all for the strategic thinking that actually matters.

The two questions that changed everything:

1. **What content patterns exist across my sessions?** (The practical engine - never run out of authentic content ideas)
2. **What are these sessions telling ME about my own journey?** (The experiment - what if every interaction is showing you something?)

You don't need to believe the second question to benefit from the first one. I encourage you to try both as experiments though.

Start with three or four recent coaching sessions. Transcribe them. Upload them to Claude in a Project. Use the prompts I've outlined here. See what patterns emerge.

You might discover you're sitting on a year's worth of newsletter content. You might discover you're teaching frameworks you didn't realize you'd systematized. You might discover you're the plumber with leaky taps in ways you never expected.

I'm still developing this process. The personal patterns piece is going to be its own project, its own set of prompts, its own daily practice.

For now though, I'm excited about what's possible.

And those Hello Kitty collectables are one step closer to being paid for.

---

## Your Turn:

Try this process with your own coaching sessions or client conversations. Then come back and tell me:

- What patterns did you discover?
- What surprised you?
- What are you going to create from it?

Drop a comment here on Substack or reply to this email. I read every single one, and I'm genuinely curious what you'll find when you hold up the mirror.

The plumber's taps are finally getting attention. How about yours?

## Example 3: Market Shift/Wake-Up Call Format

### The Advice We Were All Taught Is Now Destroying Coaching Businesses

**Subhead:** At a gathering of 8 and 9-figure coaching businesses, the evidence was incontrovertible: the old rules are toxic in 2025

**Date:** Dec 28, 2025

---

I have the privilege of coaching and working with some of the most successful coaching businesses on the planet.

Recently, I watched two of them - both leaders in their field - take opposite paths.

One founder went all-in on creating a bingeable body of work. Format-respecting content designed to communicate their philosophy and plan. Value delivered every day across carefully considered platforms. The founder dedicated half of their workweek to producing publicly facing content.

The other didn't.

That business stalled. Their external communications devolved into constant sales promotions. Webinars became hour-long testimonial marathons followed by hardcore pitches. Even their paid acquisition - which had worked for years - started going backward.

Coaching is not e-commerce. You're dealing with human beings coming to you for transformation. They need to see value before they'll trust you with their money and their growth. Sabri Suby put it perfectly: _**value is the antidote to skepticism.**_

And here's what's uncomfortable: the advice that built my understanding of business - E-Myth, Built to Sell, "build a brand not around you so it has value when you exit" - is now actively destroying coaching businesses.

The game changed. That advice is toxic now for coaching-based businesses.

---

## Lesson 1: The old rule made sense for businesses you could sell. Coaching businesses don't work that way anymore.

In 2019, if you asked someone if they had a coach, they'd look at you funny. "I don't play football."

The vast majority of people didn't know coaching existed outside of sports. As a percentage of the global audience, the coaching-aware market was tiny.

Then the pandemic hit.

The first few months were terrifying for coaching businesses. In-person events shut down overnight.

Little did we know that, after the initial panic, coaching businesses would follow with two to three years of easy mode. People had disposable income with nowhere to spend it. They thought, "Let's use this time to better ourselves."

We went from the general public not knowing about coaching to _everyone_ knowing about coaching.

That's good. More people experienced transformation. More people saw the benefits.

Here's what came with it: they also became aware that coaches vary wildly in quality. As a high-ticket purchase, they now research coaching the way they research buying a house or a car.

The numbers tell the story.

At Blackbelt, the average time from first contact to becoming a client used to be measured in weeks.

Literally a 30-day window.

Now it's eight months.

At another coaching business I observed, even an $8 book purchase - eight dollars - took an average of eight days from landing on the page to buying.

For an eight-buck book.

Your potential clients are doing their research.

If you haven't provided format-respecting content that lets them see your philosophy, your plan, how you think about the transformation they want - if you're not there during those eight months of research - you're invisible when it matters most.

It's physics (it's not, but work with me here).

Two coaches, identical offers, identical testimonials. One has a curated body of content showing incredible, consistent targeted value, post after post, day after day.

The other posts sporadically and mainly about their personal views on politics.

Who are you going to choose?

The old advice - "build a brand not around you" - assumed the founder could be removed from the equation.

In coaching, the founder (or a key person in the biz) IS the equation.

They're researching YOU.

---

## Lesson 2: Every successful coaching business I see has a main character. No exceptions.

A few months ago, I was in Palm Springs at a gathering of the crème de la crème of coaching businesses. The evidence was incontrovertible.

**Sabri Suby** went from one hour a week on content to two full days. He shoots hooks with small people tackling him, calls donkeys ugly on camera, and says, "If the ads don't make you nervous, they're not good enough." Seven people on his content team internally. Twelve externally on short form. 50 to 80 million views a month. He's the main character.

**Dan Martell's** team, led by Sam Gaudet, took him from 10,000 Instagram followers to 6.7 million across platforms. Six to seven hours prepping each YouTube video. Sam's insight: "Personal brand and AI adoption are the biggest advantages in the next decade." Dan is the main character.

**Taki Moore** made a decision: 8 of his 16 working hours each week go into content. Planned. Targeted for each platform. Format-respecting. That commitment produced a VSL, a YouTube strategy, consistent email - all flowing from the decision to show up with value, week after week. He's the main character.

**Maria Wendt** did $4 million last year selling nothing over $300. Posts several times a day. Runs a 400,000 person Facebook group. Her insight: "The more you build a brand and the more people trust you, the more likely they are to make those impulse buys." She's the main character.

**Ryan Diess** presented the "character diamond" - a systematic framework for building founder-led brand. He's teaching others to become main characters because he knows it's the game now. He's the main character.

Different niches. Different price points. Different platforms. Different personalities.

Same pattern: founder as main character.

And let me be clear about what "main character" means. This isn't influencer energy. It's not "look at my life, aren't I awesome?" There may be elements of that, and personality matters.

At the core is value. Unadulterated. Without gates. Without pulling punches. Value.

Throughout this year, I've also coached and advised hundreds of coaching businesses at BlackBelt. From the outside, they looked successful.

$30k to $600k a month.

These aren't small operations.

Their strategies - paid advertising, converting cold leads with books, free webinars - had worked for years. And by the end of 2025, those strategies were in crisis.

They were all "posting" on socials.

The volume was there.

The value wasn't.

The format respect wasn't.

Generic content that could have come from anyone, not speaking to their specific audience.

As Sabri said at Palm Springs_, They hadn't inoculated skepticism with value_.

And the market was making them pay for it.

---

## Lesson 3: "Founder as face of business" is no longer optional. They're researching you for months before they ever reach out.

The market now recognizes how good coaching is.

That's a win.

It's also a big-ticket decision. And people are taking their time.

Just like someone researching a car - the make, the model, the reviews, the test drives - they're going to spend months on this.

Here's the thing: the research is part of the fun. It's part of the buying process. They're not rushing, and they don't want to.

They want to understand your personality. Your philosophy. Your plan. The price and the fact that you genuinely get their problems.

They want to see how you think about the transformation they're after.

Travis Sago calls these the 5Ps - and your potential clients are checking every one of them, whether they know Travis's awesome framework or not.

Here's what's changed: using Eugene Schwartz's market sophistication model, everyone is now Product/most-aware.

They don't just know coaching exists.

They know there are coaches for their specific niche. They know there are multiple coaches to choose from. And because it's a significant investment, they're going to _research thoroughly_.

So the physics of choice kicks in.

Coach A is posting political views - which immediately isolates half the audience - plus opinions on science, world events, whatever's on their mind. That's what their social media looks like.

Coach B is delivering targeted, right-between-the-eyes content. "How did they know I was thinking this?" Speaking to the things their audience dares not say out loud. Providing valuable insights without pulling punches.

Who are you going to choose?

It's not even close.

And let me be direct: posting just for the sake of posting isn't the goal. Volume without value is noise. It's not about how often you show up - it's about quality and relevance to your specific market.

Feel free to post whatever you like.

Feel free not to have a successful coaching business in 2026.

Being the face of your business isn't a branding preference anymore. It's the mechanism by which potential clients decide you're worth eight months of their attention - and eventually, their money.

---

## Lesson 4: This creates a trap. You need MORE visibility at the exact moment you have LESS time.

Here's where the math breaks.

At the early-success stage - $30k+ a month - your business needs dramatic simplification. It can literally feel like 50 to 60 hours a week just to keep everything running. The business got messy on the way up, and now you don't know what to stop doing to make space for content.

You know you need to create. You can see everyone else creating...

_And you cannot figure out where the hours come from._

As the business grows, there's a team. The time pressure shifts - now it's not about doing everything yourself, it's about what happens when you redirect your focus.

Because here's the thing: before you committed to content, you were focused elsewhere. And when you shift to content, those things tend to go by the wayside.

Think of it as effectively going on "holiday" for half your working week. Because in a sense, you are. You're creating. You're focused on content production. Which, as we've established, is fundamentally crucial to the growth of your business.

What about delivery?

What about operations?

What are you saying no to in order to say yes to content?

Does the team have the support to handle it? Do they have the decision-making authority? Are your people and processes up to snuff?

If they're not, people are going to notice.

Coaching margins are magnificent. They can paper over a lot of cracks.

Until they don't.

---

## Lesson 5: The two current solutions - "Gary Vee" film crew or exceptional discipline - both have breaking points.

So how do successful coaches currently solve the visibility trap?

Two models. Both have limits.

**The Film Crew Model**

Look at Dan Martell's team. It's fantastic. Sam running content, seven hours of prep per video, multiple editors, short-form specialists - the full operation.

And a price comes with that level of coaching celebrity: you start to lose touch with what got you there. The disciplines. The approaches. The insights. The work - literally in the field, on the ground with clients.

As more of your day becomes content creation, you get removed from what's actually happening with your clients and the marketplace. That creates significant challenges. Where does the fuel for new insights come from when you're no longer close to the metal?

And here's the other thing Sam said himself: finding someone who understands your stuff deeply enough to trust with content creation - building scripts, crafting hooks, capturing your voice - is rare.

So are $150 million coaching businesses.

Thinking that once you can afford a film crew, your problems are over? They may actually just be starting.

**The Exceptional Discipline Model**

Then there are the founders with extreme discipline. They make time available. They show up. They execute the system.

And often they lack the flexibility to adapt to changes in the market and in their world.

Two of Travis Sago's 5Ps are personality and philosophy. You can transfer information, or you can transfer it in an educational, entertaining way. Given the choice, be you.

With rigid systems comes the inability for team members to add value. They follow the system to the letter because that's the way it's done. When you're early on and perhaps can't pay what Taki Moore pays his team (thank you, Taki), you might want those team members contributing ideas, not just executing orders.

I've observed that overly process-oriented founders struggle to keep their teams. They burn people out by being too literal.

The founder's operational brilliance doesn't transfer - the vast majority of team members don't exhibit that same level.

And they leave.

The advantage is operational excellence. The cost is flavour, joy, irreverence - and eventually, your team.

---

## Lesson 6: What you see is the bingeable content. What you don't see is what's making it possible.

There's a common trait across all of these examples that doesn't get talked about.

Yes, they're main characters. Yes, they're committed to content. Yes, they've made the calendar decision.

And there's something else going on behind the scenes.

Sam Gaudet named it directly: personal brand is one exponential factor for the next decade. There's a second one. He talked about it openly, and yet it stays quiet - for multiple reasons.

I look at Toni Bache (The Incredible Business Strategist and Operations Savant) at Blackbelt and know Taki is fortunate to have team members so incredibly hooked into these new tools and processes that they're literally leading the market. It's not an accident Taki made the decision to invest in this area two years ago.

Ryan Diess has Richard Lindner paving the way, creating tools to support key teams in ways that simply weren't possible before.

Blackbelt has a $24 million run-rate operation with nine people. That's $2.6 million per team member. The bingeable content is what you see. The leverage behind it is what you don't.

For core teams, these tools produce an exponential level of output that would have required three times the headcount just two years ago.

For founders, they can exponentially increase productivity and - critically - their knowledge of what's actually going on with clients, with the market, with their business.

The change is so profound that I'm effectively coming out of retirement because of it.

Lead generation. Coaching and teaching tools. And the extraordinary opportunity in operations - not just the data, but turning client success from a firefighter role into a gold mine of retention, insight, and inspiration. Taking those operational headaches and frantic hours and making them way smoother.

This is absolutely under the radar. All the major coaching businesses are using it.

It's reshaping what's possible for coaching businesses right now.

---

## Where we land

Here's where we land.

Becoming the main character for your coaching business - or having one - is no longer a branding choice. It's vital. The market has shifted. The research period has lengthened. The competition for attention has intensified.

And value remains the antidote to skepticism.

If you don't have a plan for this in 2026, that's a significant issue.

Not a "nice to have."

Not something to get around to.

A fundamental problem with how your business will grow - or won't.

The good news: there are things we're implementing at Blackbelt, and indeed a whole new layer emerging, that potentially allows you to have your cake - content - and eat it too.

The founder-as-main-character requirement isn't going away. The question is whether you'll find the leverage to meet it without burning out, hiring a film crew, or abandoning your clients to become a full-time content creator.

That's what I'll be exploring next.
