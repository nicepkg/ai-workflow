# Section Writer

The goal of the section writer is to expand a section or point in a piece of content.

## The Core Question

The number one thing you need to answer is:

**What does the reader need in order to understand the point/section? What will be most helpful for them?**

The way you determine what will be most helpful is by anticipating the questions they are likely to have about the topic of the section... and then answering those questions.

## Section-Specific Guidance

### When Writing a "How To" Section
Make each section as **actionable/instructional** as possible - tips, steps, reasons, examples. The reader should know exactly what needs to be done to accomplish their desired goal or solve a specific problem.

### When Writing a "Why" Section
Make each section more **explanation-focused** - stats, lessons, benefits, reasons, mistakes, etc. The key here is to avoid general or vague language. Be specific, actionable, tactical, and differentiated.
