## Common Content Brief Mistakes

### ❌ Avoid These

**Too Vague:**
"Write about our product"
→ No clear audience, goal, or angle

**No Research:**
Missing competitor analysis and keyword research
→ Content won't rank or differentiate

**Unclear Voice:**
"Make it engaging"
→ Not specific enough for consistency

**Missing CTAs:**
No clear next step for readers
→ Missed conversion opportunities

**Ignoring SEO:**
No keyword strategy
→ Content won't be discovered

### ✅ Do This Instead

**Specific:**
"Write 1500-word tutorial for junior developers on JWT authentication, including code examples in Node.js"

**Research-Backed:**
"Target keyword 'JWT authentication tutorial' (2.4K monthly searches), compete with existing articles from Auth0 and FreeCodeCamp"

**Clear Voice:**
"Technical but approachable - explain like a senior dev mentoring a junior, use examples, avoid jargon"

**Action-Oriented:**
"CTA: Sign up for free API key, secondary: Join Discord community"

**SEO-Optimized:**
"Primary: 'JWT authentication', Secondary: 'JSON web token Node.js', 'secure API authentication'"
