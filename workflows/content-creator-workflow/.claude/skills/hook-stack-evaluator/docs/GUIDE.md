# Hook Stack Evaluator - How It Works

## The One-Sentence Version

It's like having a sharp-eyed editor who can tell you exactly why your headline isn't stopping people - and how to fix it.

## Why This Exists

You write a headline. It feels good. You publish it. Crickets.

What went wrong? Was it the topic? The timing? The algorithm? Usually it's none of those. It's the hook. The first few words that either stop someone or let them scroll past.

The problem is, "good hook" is vague. What makes one headline grab attention while another dies? Without a framework, you're guessing.

The Hook Stack is the framework. Five layers that every attention-grabbing hook needs. Miss one, and the whole thing falls apart. Hit all five, and people can't help but engage.

This skill runs your hooks through that framework and tells you exactly what's working and what's not.

## The Mental Model: The Five-Layer Filter

Think of The Hook Stack like a water filtration system with five stages. Your hook has to pass through each stage.

**Stage 1: Earn the Stop** - Would someone actually pause scrolling for this? You're borrowing seconds of their life. Is it worth it?

**Stage 2: Start at the End** - Is there a clear payoff? Like a heist movie showing the vault first - they need to know what they're sticking around for.

**Stage 3: The Three C's** - Does it have Clarity (what's this about?), Context (what's happening?), and Curiosity (what loop needs closing?). Like a three-legged stool - one weak leg and it all crashes.

**Stage 4: Speak Their Lingo** - Is it in their words? Their specific frustrations? Or generic coach-speak? When you speak someone's language, their head snaps around.

**Stage 5: Make It Yours** - Could anyone have written this, or is it unmistakably you? Cover bands don't headline stadiums. Your unique story is your unfair advantage.

## How You Actually Use It

Drop your hook and say "score this hook" or "run through hook stack."

You get The Hook Scorecard - each layer scored 1-3 with specific feedback:

```
1. Earn the Stop: 2/3
   Opens with a decent challenge but "most coaches" is generic

2. Start at the End: 3/3
   Clear payoff - readers know exactly what they'll learn

3. The Three C's: 2/3
   - Clarity: Strong
   - Context: Strong
   - Curiosity: Weak - no open loop

...

Total Score: 11/15
```

If you're in interactive mode, you decide: Keep it, tweak it, or trash it and start fresh.

If you're in automatic mode (part of a larger workflow), the skill makes the call for you - improving weak hooks automatically.

## The Sparring Partner Mindset

This skill isn't a cheerleader. It's a sparring partner.

When something's weak, you'll hear it: "This doesn't work yet - the loop isn't open, there's no reason to keep reading."

When something's working, you'll hear that too: "OK now THAT'S a hook. The specificity in 'at 2am' is doing heavy lifting."

The goal isn't validation. It's making your hooks better. Every critique comes with a direction to improve.

## The Threshold

**< 12/15:** Needs work. At least one layer is weak enough to hurt performance.

**>= 12/15:** Ready to publish. All layers solid, hook should perform.

This isn't about perfection. It's about clearing the bar. A 12/15 hook will outperform 90% of what's on the internet because most content doesn't hit these fundamentals.

## What It's NOT

This isn't a headline generator. It evaluates and refines hooks you bring to it.

This isn't a guarantee of virality. A great hook is necessary but not sufficient - the content still needs to deliver on the promise.

This isn't a replacement for knowing your audience. Layer 4 (Speak Their Lingo) requires you to know who you're talking to.

## The Copywriter Analogy

Old-school direct response copywriters had a rule: spend 50% of your time on the headline. Because if the headline doesn't work, nobody reads the rest.

The Hook Stack is that same principle, systematized. Instead of "spend more time on it," you get a checklist. Five things to verify. Specific questions to answer.

It's the difference between "try harder" and "here's exactly what to fix."

## When to Use It

- **Before publishing** - Score your headline, refine if needed
- **After a flop** - Run the underperforming hook through, see what layer failed
- **While writing** - Generate 5 headline options, score all of them, pick the winner
- **In a pipeline** - Let newsletter-writer or carousel-agent call this automatically

The more you use it, the more the framework becomes second nature. Eventually you'll write hooks that pass all five layers on the first try.
