# AI Slop Detector - How It Works

## The One-Sentence Version

It's like having an editor who's seen a thousand AI drafts and knows exactly which phrases make readers think "a robot wrote this."

## Why This Exists

Here's the dirty secret of AI-assisted writing: it all sounds the same.

Every AI-written piece has the same tells. "It's important to note." "This isn't about X—it's about Y." "Moreover" followed by "furthermore." Em-dashes everywhere. Everything grouped in threes.

After you've read enough AI content, you can spot it in seconds. And so can your audience.

The problem isn't that AI helps you write. The problem is that AI has a fingerprint - a recognizable pattern that screams "I didn't actually write this."

This skill is your fingerprint eraser.

## The Mental Model: The Editor's Red Pen

Think of this skill like working with a really good editor who's obsessed with one thing: authenticity.

They're not changing your ideas. They're not restructuring your argument. They're doing a very specific job: finding every phrase that sounds like a machine wrote it, and replacing it with something that sounds like you wrote it.

It's the difference between:
- "The solution leverages cutting-edge technology to facilitate enhanced user experiences"
- "The solution uses new tech to make things easier for users"

Same meaning. Completely different feel.

## How You Actually Use It

Drop in any text and say one of these:
- "Run this through the slop detector"
- "Clean this up"
- "Remove the AI fingerprints"

You get back the cleaned version. That's it. No explanation of what changed, no before/after comparison. Just the polished text, ready to use.

**Pro tip:** Use it as the last step before publishing anything. Newsletter draft done? Run it through. LinkedIn post written? Clean it up. It's a 30-second quality gate that makes everything sound more human.

## What It's Looking For

The skill has a mental checklist of AI patterns. Things like:

**The Promotional Stuff** - "stands as a testament," "rich cultural heritage," "breathtaking." Real writers use specific details, not generic praise.

**The Hedging** - "It's important to note," "It's worth mentioning." Real writers just say the thing.

**The Transitions** - "Moreover," "Furthermore," "In addition." Real writers vary their connectors or just combine sentences.

**The Contrast Formula** - "This isn't about X—it's about Y." This one's everywhere in AI writing. Real writers make positive assertions.

**The Corporate Speak** - "Leverages," "facilitates," "utilized." Real writers say "uses," "helps," "used."

## What It's NOT

This isn't a fact-checker. It won't catch wrong information.

This isn't a structural editor. It won't reorganize your piece.

This isn't a voice coach. It removes AI patterns, but it doesn't add your unique voice - that's still your job.

Think of it as a cleanup crew, not a ghostwriter. It takes out the garbage, but you still need to furnish the room.

## The Copywriter Analogy

You know how experienced copywriters can spot amateur copy instantly? Not because of grammar mistakes, but because of tells. Passive voice where active would punch harder. Features instead of benefits. Headlines that tell instead of sell.

AI writing has the same kind of tells. This skill is trained to spot them the way a veteran copywriter spots weak copy. It's pattern recognition, applied to AI fingerprints.

The goal: make your AI-assisted content indistinguishable from content you wrote yourself on your best day.
