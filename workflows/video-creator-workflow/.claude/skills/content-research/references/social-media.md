# Social Media Content Patterns

## Platform-Specific Formats

### Twitter/X Thread (5-12 tweets)

**Structure:**
```
TWEET 1 (HOOK):
Bold claim + promise of value
"I spent 6 months studying [topic]. Here's what nobody tells you: [surprising insight]"

TWEET 2-3 (CONTEXT):
Set up the problem/situation
Include a specific data point or story

TWEET 4-8 (CORE CONTENT):
Each tweet = one insight
Use numbers: "1/ Here's the first thing..."
Include specific examples

TWEET 9-10 (EVIDENCE):
Quote an expert or cite a source
Share a mini case study

TWEET 11 (TAKEAWAY):
Summarize the key insight
What to do with this information

TWEET 12 (CTA):
Invite engagement
Offer something valuable (link, resource, follow)
```

**Hook Formulas That Work:**
- "I [did thing] for [time]. Here's what I learned:"
- "Most people think [common belief]. They're wrong. Here's why:"
- "The [industry] is about to change forever. Here's what's coming:"
- "[Number] things I wish I knew about [topic] before [event]:"

### LinkedIn Post (1300-3000 characters)

**Structure:**
```
LINE 1-2: Hook (visible in preview)
- Personal story opening
- Surprising observation
- Contrarian take

LINE 3: [Empty line for readability]

BODY (5-7 short paragraphs):
- Each paragraph: 1-2 sentences
- Break up with line breaks
- Include personal experience
- Add specific numbers/examples

CONCLUSION:
- Lesson learned
- Question to drive engagement

HASHTAGS (3-5 max):
- At the end, not throughout
- Mix broad (#Leadership) with specific (#B2BSaaS)
```

**Winning Formats:**
1. **Story format**: "3 years ago, I made a mistake that cost us $50K..."
2. **Lessons format**: "After 10 years in [field], here are 5 truths nobody told me"
3. **Observation format**: "I've interviewed 50 [role] this year. One pattern keeps emerging..."
4. **Myth-busting**: "Popular advice: [common wisdom]. Reality: [contrarian view]"

### LinkedIn Article (750-1500 words)

- **Title**: Specific outcome or clear promise
- **Featured image**: Custom graphic, not stock photo
- **Opening**: Personal hook within 2 sentences
- **Subheadings**: Every 150-200 words
- **Format**: Mix paragraphs with bullets
- **Expert quotes**: 1-2 to add credibility
- **Conclusion**: Clear takeaway + engagement question

## Content Pillars for Product Launches

### Pillar 1: Problem Awareness
- Share industry pain points with data
- Tell stories of struggling with the problem
- Quote others who've faced the challenge

### Pillar 2: Solution Education
- How-to content (not selling, teaching)
- Behind-the-scenes of building the solution
- Expert insights on the approach

### Pillar 3: Social Proof
- Customer stories (with permission)
- Results and metrics
- Third-party validation

### Pillar 4: Thought Leadership
- Industry trend analysis
- Predictions with reasoning
- Contrarian perspectives with evidence

## Engagement Optimization

### Optimal Posting Elements:
- **Visual**: Posts with images/graphics get 2-3x engagement
- **First comment**: Add context or ask a question
- **Timing**: Reply to early commenters within 30 mins
- **Tag**: Mention relevant people/companies (sparingly)

### Call-to-Actions That Work:
| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "What do you think?" | "Have you seen this in your company? What happened?" |
| "Share your thoughts" | "What's the #1 thing holding your team back from [goal]?" |
| "Like if you agree" | "Which of these resonates most with your experience?" |
| "Follow for more" | [Omit—deliver value and they'll follow] |

## Voice & Authenticity

### Personal Voice Elements:
- Use "I" and "we" naturally
- Share specific failures, not just wins
- Include details only you would know
- Show the work/process, not just results

### Red Flags (Sounds AI-Generated):
- Perfect grammar in casual contexts
- No contractions ("do not" vs "don't")
- Generic examples ("Company X achieved...")
- Listicles without personal insight
- Emoji overuse or misuse
- Starting every paragraph the same way

### Making It Human:
- Include a specific detail: "Last Tuesday at 2am..."
- Reference real people: "My mentor Sarah always says..."
- Admit uncertainty: "I'm still figuring out..."
- Show personality: humor, frustration, excitement
