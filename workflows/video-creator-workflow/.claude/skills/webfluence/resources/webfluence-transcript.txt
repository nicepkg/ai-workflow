Tamara
so guys i want to talk to you about this concept of webfluence yeah and webfluence is a term i made up because we all know that when you smush two words together magic happens right and if you think about the journey that we've had so far it all started with brand width yeah and we've got some newbies here on the call so what i'm going to try and do is as we kind of move through this pathway. I'm going to reference trainings. And hopefully my goal for today is to kind of bring everything that we have been teaching over the last 18 months together, because this is going to be the practical session that's going to help you execute on everything that Taki has been teaching. Yeah. Now, whilst some of you might think that WebFluence is really only for the people who are doing sales lists and guys, my newbies, it's okay. I'll, I'll explain all these random words. sometimes it feels like a cult when we're, when we say all these words, right? When it's not just going to be helpful when you do sales list, generating web fluence and architecting web fluence is going to help you sell full stop, whether you're doing calls or whether you are sales list. Okay. And the concept is all about the fact that the funnel, right? The funnel, the funnel is dead. Okay. The funnel is dead. We're killing it. And over the last 18 months, you would have heard Taki talk about this. He's talking about this thing called a web, right? A content web. So if you think about the concept of a funnel, right? It has this direction. It has this flow. And what we try to do inside of a funnel is we try to get them to book a call or get them to make a purchase as quickly as possible. And that's just not happening anymore. Buyers, they don't move in straight lines. They move through this ecosystem now. They see a post. They'll watch a reel. They'll They'll forget about you. They'll binge your videos for a couple of weeks and then they buy, right? That's actually how people really buy. And the system that supports that all is called Webfluence. It's about architecting the content web, okay? So if we, oh, I've got to go this way. I don't know how you guys do this. Okay, funnels. Let's see how I can draw. Funnels. That's your funnel, right? That will built for a world where buyers moved in a straight line. You had an ad, you had an opt-in, maybe. You had an email. Is this looking familiar? You had a call. And then if you're lucky, you had a sale. That is your funnel. That is what your funnel looked like. That's what we're used to over the past few years. Yeah. I'm going to challenge that now. Today, we're moving in a web, which my drawing skills. Now it's a web. But look at that. All right. If that was your funnel, if this was your funnel onto the left, and we're now moving towards a web, what does that web look like? Right? We're looking at things like in the middle, you might have, oh, actually, let's call it a VSL. I'm going to do ours. We've got a VSL. But the thing that drives people around before they get to the VSL are going to be things like, for us, it's IG videos, right? For you, that could be LinkedIn posts. It's short form content. For us, we then also drive to some YouTube videos. This could also be like your emails. It could be a podcast. And so you're like, yeah, but Tamara, that's just like lots of funnels all going to the center. But that's not actually how people move through it. Okay. They might start over here and they come in here and then they land on your channel. Oh, and they go like this and they might binge. And you hear Taki talking about binges being buyers. Then they forget about you. Right. And then they enter in here and then they'll see another Instagram post. Then they'll come over here. And again, they land on the channel like this and then they might come like this. Yeah. And then they land on the BSL. So that's what we're talking about. I'm an artiste. So that's what we're talking about when we talk about it being a web and not a funnel. Do you see how the movement can happen? And do you kind of recognize your own behavior now? Some of you guys are like when I do the same thing, I'm in paid ads, right? And you guys would architect this funnel and you're like, when they watch this, then we're going to retarget them. They're going to do this. And then we're going to do that. And then we're going to do this. And you try to control this experience. And that's just not how life happens. Sometimes people are off the platforms and they don't see that content, the next piece of content that you want them to see. And so then there's these gaps. And sometimes you won't see someone for a while, especially when we're talking about short form content, the algorithm. Remember, you're like, you forgot you followed someone and then all of a sudden their post came up and then you go to their page and you're like, oh, they've been posting this whole time. Yeah. So this happens. This is actually how things happen in the general scheme of things. And so when we're actually looking at how we can move from a web, sorry, from a funnel to a web, the ultimate goal is to generate brand width. So for those of us that are new, brand width is what started it all for us. We got better at our content. Why? Because we were going to increase time spent on brand. Yeah, Mark, you absolutely need to answer, support the journey, problem aware solution, problem aware, et cetera. Totally. Here's the thing about the web that a lot of the people who are doing funnels find really difficult. Attribution. Attribution is broken. Nobody buys through one click or one ad or one path. But attention tells the truth, right? The more time someone spends with your content, the faster they buy. And in our data, if you watch the original brand with content, you would remember, I think it was Sharon did a bit of a test and he found it like he kind of came up with this arbitrary. Well, it's not arbitrary. in his research, he found that every buyer had consumed roughly 47 minutes of content before saying yes. And so my challenge to you is if your brand with you had to generate or execute, deliver 47 minutes of content before someone said yes, do you think that the way that you currently structure your web, which is the new word for your funnel, do you think it's actually doing that? Right? Because that's what brand with is all about. It's about measuring and engineering time on brand instead of this obsession that we have over funnels, right? So if brand width is about building belief through the binge time, right? Binges are buyers. If we can get them to watch 47 minutes, guys, I'm making the number up. Just say 47 minutes. What happens if we remove sales calls completely? That was where we were 18 months ago, right? That was the theory. We started with brand width and that's where Taki started his one email a day and he got better at content. And then we had all this content and then we generated this 30 day like onboarding sequence in essence, right? Any new content contact would get this 30 days instead of the 14 day new lead sequence because we had to kick it off with something, right? Gabriel, 47 minutes came from, it's not for everyone, but essentially it came from a, an insight that Sharon had where he found that in his research for his buyers, they had spent on average 47 minutes. So I want you to just use that in your mind. It doesn't have to be exactly 47 minutes, but by quantifying, oh, okay, I have to generate a set amount of time for this prospect to spend on my content. All of a sudden, you're like, crap, okay, maybe driving traffic to the VSL from the get-go is a little bit premature. Yeah. So 47, making it up, but it just kind of makes you go, whoa, okay. The whole binges and the whole binges are buyers concept that has just brought that to life. So if we can increase time spent on brands through content that shifts beliefs. And we can, when marketing builds belief, right? If you go to your slides, persuasion, i.e. the sales call becomes unnecessary, right? If your marketing can do the heavy lifting, you don't have to push so hard on that sales call, right? That's where, that's where we got to with brand width. That's where we came to this hypothesis. Does everyone remember that for those of us that have been here a while? So that's where we got to. And that's where we started introducing this concept of the sales list experience. I had COVID. This was three days before Christmas. And I got a text message and it was like, it's happening. We're doing it. No freaking notice. We decided to test this theory. Okay. So you all know the story. If you have watched the sales list experiment training, we had nine people in sales. We paid them to sit out for 90 days. We had to prove this hypothesis that marketing alone, if done right, could replace every single sales calls. And you know the outcome. Within three months, our sales had doubled. We had no DMs, as in people in our DMs. We did no chasing and we had no calls. That reinforced that insight of when your marketing builds belief, persuasion becomes unnecessary. Yeah. Is everyone picking up what I'm putting down? That's where we're at. I'm doing a little historical to get us where we're at. So that's kind of where we ended up with salesless. So let's talk about how we actually did it. Let's talk tactics. This looks familiar to everyone, yeah? The system. So let's start talking about how we actually did it. And this essentially will give you all of the elements that kind of make up the sales method. All right. So we kind of started things off with an offer doc. We introduced brand width. We started, actually, no, we started doing the paid workshop. So we kind of started here and we started doing the paid workshop. In the paid workshop, we introduced the offer doc. That was about six months in. We started getting better at our short form. We were introducing micromagnets and we started building out our chat, our many chat automations that allowed us to, with our paid workshop, we were able to build belief and engagement. Let's kind of come here. We were able to build belief and engagement. Hopefully my writing's not as bad as Ed's. The offer doc replaced the sales call with our short form. We created reach. Oh, there we go. Somehow on the There we go. Created reach and recall. What else did we do? Many chat automations here, right? We qualified and nurtured leads here. We had some email campaigns that drove traffic and reinforced belief. Notice that we haven't even gotten to the YouTube yet. The YouTube. I feel like my dad. The YouTube. What am I missing? We did. Did we do VSL first? Let's go over here to long form. In long form, we deepened belief, right? And authority. Micromagnets, they essentially acted as like traffic drivers, got people into the many chat. What am I missing? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And then the final piece is your brand width tracking, right? Which is kind of like the whole thing. All of that together measured time on brand. Make sense? So that's kind of how we started putting it together. We did not implement everything all at once. And we did things in pieces, right? I don't want you having to execute everything in like three weeks. We spent six months on emails and short form content. No nils. We started with an email a day. We started improving our content because the content had to get better so that we could then introduce the workshops. Make sense? So every piece, sorry, every piece of this puzzle replaced over time, a piece of the old sales team's job, right? It made the business fun. It made the business lighter and it made the business faster. And you know, as a founder, you don't want this heavy chugging business. You don't want it to be hard. And so if you think of it as like you don't just flick the switch and go salesless, it's this thing that builds over time. This is going to make it so much lighter for you. And for those of you that even do sales calls, you can see how all of those pieces could actually make that sales call better. Si's on the call. And Si, I'm going to get you to jump off mute real quick. Remember a couple of weeks ago we were on a jam and you were like, when they've done the homework and they quote you on the call, tell me a little bit about that. How does that make the call?

Si Harris
I think what gets me is when people, I introduce myself on the call as Simon Harris, right, and they go, who's that? And they go, oh, is that Cy Harris? They go, yeah, yeah, yeah, because that's my informal name. But then they will often say, I've been watching your stuff, or I love everything you write. It makes so much sense. How do we get started? So just build belief. And what did you say? No persuasion required.

Tamara
Yeah, it reduces this persuasion that you would normally do on the call.

Si Harris
So if you have a call, yeah. Yeah, they're really short. And it's almost like you've been given the hottest referral ever and they just want to get started. Like Taryn says, shut up and take my money. It was Ken. And Taryn's one that someone says, how do I pay you? That's the sort of stuff that we've started to see happening really.

Tamara
Who wants like calls that feel like referrals every single day? Because you know what they're like. The referrals, they come with implied trust. And you're just like, let's just have a 10-minute call. Let's just close the business. Yeah. This is what Webfluence is about. It's how can we actually architect brand width? because what I'm seeing, and this is why this topic is so important, Ed and I were seeing this all the time. And we're like, you know, Taki's teaching these epic trainings and he's like, VSL, offer doc. And you guys are like, cool. I just dropped an offer doc into like my list and it didn't, no one bought. It's because we're not building this piece of executing this brand width, this time spent on brand. So 47 minutes, Gabriel, let's just, let's just use that as the marker. You don't have to architect 47 minutes, but 47 minutes is a long time. And it makes you go, okay, crap, mine's too short, right? So I want you to use it as like just this little filter to make you say, am I executing a web that allows someone to binge 47 pieces of content, says Ken, or 47 minutes of content if you have got long form and things like that. Yeah. So brand width, it built belief. Salesless proved it could sell. This tactical ladder, right? This system, it gave us the method. But webfluence is going to give us the architecture, right? The web is the thing that ties it all together. Cool. So let's have a look at how the web works. Let's go over here to the five layers of the content web before we go into it. So I want you to see the pieces before we go into like the actual thing, right? There's different layers that make up your web. You've got your core piece. For us, it's our VSL, yeah? This converts belief into buying intent. This is your 24-7 salesperson. You can be up at 3 in the morning, Tark is dead to the world, Vanessa's dead to the world, and this thing is selling while he sleeps. That's for us. Yours could be something else. But for us, our web centers around the VSL, yeah? Then we have this middle layer, the middle ring. This builds authority and connection. For us, why does it keep going to my eraser? For us, it's YouTube. Taki loves YouTube at the moment. Guys, he secretly loves it because it's different. It's like Dan Martel's been doing like a video a week for like nine years now. And he's very envious of that discipline. And so now he's like really getting into long form. It allows him to really go deep. And then you've got this outer ring, right? This is what drives reach and awareness. This is your short form. Yeah, makes sense. Then you've got these connectors that connect everything together. Love me my purple. So what connects them together, right? What drives them to each other? This is going to be your many chat automations. This is going to be your GPT tools, right? We use our power-ups. Yeah. And then you've got this, we call it like the compounder. It keeps everything evergreen. And for us, that is the long tail belief machine of our channel. What happens when you land on someone's YouTube channel? You see a really good video. Like it might come up in your feed. Oh yeah, he's loving the fact he's got abs. Hey Gabe. Guys, what happens if you land on a really good YouTube video? You're like, who's this person? And you go to their channel and then you go and watch this other video and you watch this other video and you watch this other video. That's what our YouTube channel is for us. We binge. Some people also do that on Instagram, right? But we use YouTube as ours. Yeah. So if we were to say that each layer has a purpose and together they build momentum, your goal isn't to make more anymore. It's to connect. So you know how people ask the question, how many times should I be posting on Instagram? How many times? If I take you back to Caleb Ralston's brand camp, as many times as it takes to publish something of value. He does not want you to go, I need to post five times and then retrofit to that. If you don't have anything interesting to say, don't say it. So let's look at our web in action. This is the stolen piece, guys. This is the stolen piece. So do not share this. This is how ours works in practice, yeah? So every week, let's start here. This, guys, that's our VSL, yeah? And what happens is every week we record one long-form video. Long-form. Actually, let's call it YouTube. YouTube video. We record one long-form video. And what we do is we cut it into three reels. We don't cut. We film three reels. I don't want to put the wrong words into your mouth and you're all off cutting long form pieces of content. We create one video long form and we create three reels that talk about the same topic of the video. Yeah. Each of these pieces connects back to the bridge of the video, which is the VSL. Yeah. This is what builds belief over time. And so every week you're doing this and we're going one, two, three, and that connects back into there. And I don't know if you guys noticed, you know how we like confused minds don't buy one CTA. Has anyone actually seen that there's more than one CTA? There is. And the CTA is twofold. Yeah. We've got each of these reels has two CTAs. One of them is comment the keyword to watch the full, sorry, I would say it's first grab the GPT tool. So comment the keyword. here's our, do you want the thing? Here's the thing. Or comment the keyword to watch the full video. So these reels promote this, right? You've got this piece of content promotes maybe a GPT, but it also promotes and drives traffic to the YouTube video. Make sense? Let me just see if there's anything in the chat going. Yeah, I love that Ken has like come into valid. I need to like stop myself from saying cut. I don't want people to think that we're cutting long form. We're not, we're creating for the channel. And so in the GPT tool, if any of you guys have used the tool, it'll like, you know, help you with the thing that it's helping you to do, whether it's the banger or whether it's the gold mine or whatever it is. And then even after a while, it will also push you back to the YouTube channel, right? If you want to watch the whole thing, go to the YouTube channel. Here's the video. And so every piece of that short form content is a doorway and it either pulls people into the YouTube video or it pulls people into the chat where we then move them towards the bridge video, which is the VSL, right? Don't forget in this whole experience, what happens? Life. I watch the reel. I might play with the GPT and then I duck out because life happens. So I'm not always necessarily going towards the center all the time. So Gabe, to get really into the mechanics, It's not necessarily two CTAs on a reel all the time. Sometimes it's comment banger to get the tool. And inside of the tool, for instance, it can be, hey, do you want the long form video? And it can push you that way. If you enter into a many chat sequence, it can deliver it that way. So it can go, hey, cool. Do you want that? Here's the tool. By the way, do you want the full video? That's good. The full video helps you win faster, right? If anyone has gone back into, say, the 100 Lead Bundle training, it's a similar tactic, right? It's, hey, cool. Here's the thing. Do you also want the videos to help you execute that faster? Yeah. So Mick, that's the actual VSL training. We have a VSL. It is unlisted on YouTube. We drive people. Yeah. Thank you, Gabe, for dropping that into the chat. We have a VSL. This VSL is not the VSL training. The VSL training that you've just dropped in the chat is how to create your VSL. You don't have to create a VSL. The center of ours is a VSL. Your center could be a paid workshop. It could be anything else, right? But this is how our web works, yeah? And notice that I'm kind of saying, yeah, sometimes it's this, sometimes it's that. It's because you guys are really stuck on this funnel thing. It's not the same all the time, right? It's going to be this messy thing. Sometimes you're going to drive it in here. Yeah, cool. That can drive it in there. Sometimes you're going to go like this. You're going to go like this because you're not going to take action on the CTA here, right? you watch this and now you're binging. You're in the YouTube channel. Now you're jumping around. Then this one catches your eye and then it drives you to the VSL because everyone's different. Not everyone is going. If you guys just looked at this, that's like a funnel. That's not how people operate. People don't operate in this linear manner anymore. And so you need to, I'm just looking at my diagram. I'm so not an artist guys, but can you start to see that it's messy and it's webby and we need to kind of let go of this controlled pathway. So this video does this and then that video does that. No, because people don't act like that. It is so much harder to track funnel flow, Giorgio. Absolutely. Which brings us back to attribution is broken. Attention tells the truth. This is why when people go, so what's the bench, like what's the number of people that go from here to here? I don't know because some people have ADHD and some people don't. And some people, like it's different for everyone. Yeah. So the goal is to create this web, right? And that's what I want you guys to understand is that people are human, right? This thing that you saw on Instagram drives to this video. You may or may not go to that video. Then you see this short form piece of content. It drives to that video. Maybe you didn't click on the link or ask for the, what is it? You didn't comment. So you watch this video and this video, right? And then you're stuck out here on Instagram watching stuff, slowly shifting beliefs, but some of them are driving you into these YouTube channels. One of you guys might watch this and then leapfrog and then leapfrog and then leapfrog. And then this is how we're delivering brand with. Some of you guys are like, I never knew Taki until about three weeks ago. And that's because you go, you saw this video, like you saw this and you jumped in here or you found him on YouTube and you just went, yeah, one, two, three, boom. Because shifting beliefs for each person is different. What was that question about the layers? Where was it? Can you quickly restate the five layers? Well, actually, no, we're going to measure it because here, these are your five layers. So based off what I just took you through, right? We all have a content web. We all have a funnel, whether you think you have one or not, because you either architect it or people just flow. So water going down, you know, when like water will break free out of like a river and then it funnels, it'll follow a pathway and you either dig the trench for the water to flow or it's just going to figure it out itself. Everyone has a funnel. It's just how good you built your trench. So if you were to get to this, how does your web score? Everyone has a web right now, whether they think they do or not. And I want us to have a think about if we were to judge ours and measure our webs right now, what would we give it out of five? So let's go to the first one. So firstly, let's kind of spend like 10 seconds. Okay. Go. What does my content web look like right now? I put out short form. This is essentially like your system. So I want you to have it in your mind, what your web looks like. Currently it might be a funnel. That's totally fine. Mario. It's essentially what your, what your funnel is right now. How are people consuming your content, right? That the new word for it is a web. Oh, good. Because I was trying really nicely to like answer that. And I really just wanted to say, where have you been this whole session? Don't make me nervous guys. Okay. So I want you guys to critique yourselves. I'm going to put some music. I'm going to put some music on. Let's listen to some music. So coverage. In your current web or funnel, you have content for cold audiences, for warm audiences, and for hot audiences. Does everyone know what I'm talking about? Cold are people that don't know you, warm are people that kind of like move around, and hot are people that have like, you know, really kind of been quiet and they're chomping at the bit for you. Out of five, one being poor, five being amazing. What does that look like? Third one is consistency, right? This is what makes up a healthy content web? You show up rhythmically, consistently. Notice I didn't say frequently. I don't care if it's once a week, as long as it's each week. I'm not looking for volume. I'm looking for consistency. I show up rhythmically, consistently out of five, please. The fourth layer, conversion. Every piece of content leads somewhere. Notice I said somewhere, not book a call or not buy my stuff. That's just my nice fancy way of saying there's a call to action on everything. So conversion. All right. How is conversion different than connection? Connection is about every piece linking to another, right? Conversion is about physically, like connection is like the information is linking to other ideas. Connection is about you're physically moving someone through to another piece. Go watch this thing, go do this thing. make sense finally out of five belief flow content builds belief not just awareness this one's a tricky one I want us to critique out of five is your content building belief not just awareness are you shifting beliefs in here okay so this is where we're at right now right this is how you are creating your baseline of where you are currently. And that's okay if your numbers are low because no one kind of pulled apart the web, but now you know the elements that's needed to create a healthy web. Yep, Mark, eBooks are content too. The only thing about it is they're kind of like stuck in one spot, but as long as you're like driving traffic in and out of them, you could call that content, right? A healthy web doesn't just attract, it advances, it moves people. Your connection and your belief flow. This is the secret sauce. And this is usually where most people fall short. What were the two things that you had the lowest scores on? Can you put them in the chat, please? Coverage and connection, says Jim. Consistency and connection, says Nils. Coverage and consistency. Legrand's law on short form connections. Connection consistency. Connection coverage. Okay. What do we think that's costing us? Yeah. Yeah. It's costing us cash. I get Like that's like the easy answer. But it's like, for me, it's like, it's costing us like missed opportunity. Like it's missed opportunity guys, because you've got all these other pieces and it feels like there's just these little things that we can tweak to make everything work better. And it is, it's, it feels like we're doing a lot of churn and heavy lifting. If I'm in the meta space guys, like the meta, like Zuckerberg meta, not meta meta. And if anyone is in the paid ad space, you would know that we're talking about the Andromeda changes and all you would have heard about creative is the new targeting. And if anyone is running like decent numbers, like money through Meta, all you're hearing about is like creative, creative, creative. And so people are just churning out creative like no one's business. And I don't want us to fall into that cycle. But what it means is, and what I think is going to happen even more so is this whole attention span that is very limited right now is going to get even more so because the way people are just kind of like throwing content into the space, it's just really, really messy. It's messy. It's hard work. And if we just kind of took a pause and focused on quality, we don't have to worry about frequency, about a lot of it. We only have to worry about quality and then engineering the pathway through it. Yeah. People are getting tired, Mick. I'm tired. I'm exhausted, right? We're It's exhausting. And clients who have to create this stuff are getting tired. Okay, next slide. If you guys open up your books, your workbooks, I gave you guys like your own little web. Let's map our own web out, yeah? I want us to kind of spend a few minutes on... Where's the chat going? If we had to now, looking back of how we scored ourselves, looking back on how Taki creates his web using the elements that he has, right swap this out this slide out with your slide you know what your elements are we bring it down here there's your layers this is our web this is where what the health of your current web looks like using the elements from the system knowing the layers of the web how could we architect our own web yeah do we feel confident if we were to spend a few minutes on this to maybe map out our own web or did I just kind of like talk at you a lot? We're going to map out our own web. Yeah. Okay. So guys, let's just have a play and you can use the Taki example to guide you. If we had to map out our own web, Mark, you're thinking really tactically at the moment. Let's just map out the web first and then we'll map out how we do it. Right. How do you link a short form video in Insta Facebook to a longer form video on YouTube? We can deploy that through many chat, right? message me the word this, and then we can deploy it that way. You could, some people, we do it sometimes in email. Yeah. So that's just the logistics. So guys, I want us to spend about five minutes mapping out our web. I want us to consider, let me get some cool tunes going. I want us to consider a few things. What is the thing that we're driving everyone to? What's the outer layer of our web? What's our longer form content? Guys, it could be email. And then what's that short form that's sitting in that attract stage? This web diagram is simply just a rejig version of your system. That's all it is. Does everyone know the assignment? Okay, I'm going to give you guys five minutes. I don't have fancy clocks, so I'm going to give you... I'll time code. I'll call it out. So David's asking if the workshop is the center, wouldn't we have to run workshops weekly in order to get sales every week? Yeah, we run our workshop monthly. Why? Because guys, it took a year to get Taki to film clients. We're not going to push our luck. So we do it monthly. Some people do run weekly workshops. The Savages, they run weekly workshops. Every single week they run theirs. We build ours up. We actually only take people in once a month. And then we, for some people that trickle into the VSL, they get this like backdoor key, like a secret key. And so we do get some applications throughout the month, but we do intake now once a month. The last few months we have been at capacity and we have shut the doors early. We've always kind of gone, do we want to go back to fortnightly intakes like kickoff calls? Because we build out our onboarding experience around the kickoff call. We have learned our lesson. If they don't go on the kickoff call first, they just don't get it, right? They don't understand black belt. And if they don't understand black belt, they kind of come in and go a bit cray cray and end up doing this weird stuff. And then it takes a little while to course correct. We have kind of come to this rhythm for our onboarding that we start off with the kickoff call and we make you go to the damn kickoff call. Do you know how many emails we get saying, that's really late for me. Can I like not do that? No, you gotta go. Some guy had to take his mom to the airport. We let him off. We gave him a recording. That's important because it sets the scene. It sets the expectations. Then we move them into a game plan. Then we do velocity calls. Then you're in gen pop. That's my term, guys. Sorry. But we love the prison, right? So that's what works for us. Am I sitting here saying, don't take clients every week? No. We also need to mesh in your preferences for how you want to run your business. I asked the question when we're at capacity, Do we want to introduce the fortnightly workshops, the kickoff calls? No, we used to do that. And Taki just doesn't want to because he doesn't want to. Not because there's any mathematical anything. He just doesn't feel like it. Part of him being a founder in his business is that he wants to make it fun and he wants to make it light. And so him showing up every fortnight to deliver the same kickoff call is heavy for him. So some of this stuff is not best practice. It's also, you've got to mix it in with like how you want to show up in your business. So for those of you that haven't done the training about designing your lifestyle empire, definitely go and do that, especially as we're coming up to the end of the year. Set yourself this, the scene of how you want your 2026 to roll out, how you want to show up in your business in 2026, because it's going to guide everything that you do in your business. Yeah. Let's have a look at some questions. All right. Where we go? Where would the workshop sit? You can have it in the middle. Patty, we have one conversion event a month. That for us can be the middle. Our VSL is not the only way that we take in clients, but it is how we deliver content, if that makes sense. We have a weekly email cadence, the six-week campaign cadence, right? That will take you through the things of what to talk about each week in your email. And in it, we talk about how we will, in the last week of the month, we will do the open closed doors. So that means the week before we have to have executed on the workshop because we do the workshop. Then we open the doors and close the doors. Why? Because the first Tuesday of every month, we do our kickoff call. So we have to give everyone enough time to buy in, get ready, come to the kickoff call. And you can design that to your cadence. It's called the six-week campaign cadence. And it's crazy that we uplifted our ad content quality and got instant results. Now it's time to do that for Organic Social and Build a Web. Absolutely. M, or is it Will? It's Will. I'm just looking at the name and I can't see you. So do you want to speak to this? I know that Gabe's asking a couple of questions. What do you mean by lifting your ad content quality?

BB Member 1
Yeah, so we did video in our ad. And so we uplifted our script. Thanks, Tony, for detailing out the main parts. Like the big difference is the emotional gut punch in there.

Tamara
the she's like jiggled the knife around is what we're trying to say right yeah they got to felt

BB Member 1
the pain that they you know would normally feel when they thought about it could you give an example um yeah so our target audience the people who at the moment are struggling to find work and it's a problem because literally like there's 250 people applying for every job right now and yeah what they're struggling with is they're sending out application after application and they're not getting any interviews. So we just kind of, you know, went under the surface on that a little bit and then we pushed them to our webinar. The results were basically three times conversion on our sales outcome. So, yeah.

Tamara
Who wants some of that? And so that went from something as simple as maybe AdCopy saying, you're applying for lots of jobs and you're not hearing back to you're applying for lots of jobs you're slaving away over your resume you're doing this you're doing that the kids are this the blah blah like going deeper jiggle like the knife's in you've got to jiggle it around and cause some more

BB Member 1
pain right does that sound about right will yeah yeah and like it's stressful if you have been have you lost your job and you're trying to find a job and no one's getting back to you like their mind is going crazy. So we just go into that.

Tamara
Yeah, exactly. Guys, if you want some help with that, 16-word sales page letter. Great writing exercise. I think I butchered the name of the training, 16-word sales. Just type in 16-word. Ben's going to find it for you because Ben's my wing peep. It's a really great writing exercise that gets you deep into the problems of your avatar. You're not necessarily writing for anything, but you can use that to write ads, to write a sales letter, to write, Gabe, you've got the book. It's literally the exercise in that

Speaker 4
book. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this guy, Evaldo Albuquerque, English is his second language. And he was like the highest performing copywriter for Agora Financial. And he breaks down what a unique mechanism, all that in this book. Yeah. Really killer book. It's an awesome exercise.

Tamara
If you guys go to that training, we actually did a big writing exercise. Write that out, spend, turn everything off. It's one of those, you've got to be in flow kind of writing exercises. That is going to help you create this, you know, painful copy. You're going to get deep into the problems that your avatar has. All right, Natalie, I'm stuck because I don't have long form like a podcast or YouTube. Does one piece of the web need to be long form? Look, it doesn't, right? But don't forget, if we go back to the system, right? Let's come back up on your, okay, mine's all butchered. But if you come back to the system, yeah, we have long form here. That's good. Like we have long form, we have VSL, we have chat and we have email. You don't need all of it. If you rewatch this, you might just go like this. I've got short form, I've got chat and email. Guys, at the very least, for the love of God, get yourself some bloody email. This thing saved us. A few years ago, when our ads stopped, like our ad account got shut down for 12 months because our buyer got hacked. We need this other platform. You could, you need to work out what your elements are. So if you haven't already, right, work your way through this so that you know the elements that you're working with. And then as Taki explains in the video, we need to like create our path. Yeah. So long form does help, but there's things that you can do in the meantime to help elevate. It's just how can we move them to different pieces? Yeah. And the concept of a YouTube channel, like we do this without boosting. You know how you drive the traffic to the Instagram profile? People still do the binging there. Got it? So that's how, like before we even had YouTube, we were still able to execute on brand width. Don't forget our YouTube channel launched in March this year. That's it. It's new. It's very, very new for us. We were still executing on brand width before we had YouTube, before we had a VSL for a good year. So if you're starting out, I want you to start with the brand with training. I want you to watch the salesless experiment for context, not necessarily to go salesless. Then I want you to watch the system to work out what we're working towards. Doesn't have to all happen today so that you know the pieces. And then we work with what we've got now and we slowly move towards building everything out. I don't want you to rush the execution of all the pieces. I want you to get good at the pieces that you've got first. Taki did two cycles of emails, right? It looks really nice and easy now. And I like to remind people that the first cycle, he's like, I'm doing emails. We're like, yay, we've been waiting for this. He does three in a row. Amazing. Cool. He was a little bit, you know, he hadn't written for a while. It was okay. And silence. We're like, hey, Tarks, where's today's email? Oh yeah, it's coming. didn't come next day. Hey, Tux, where's that email? Oh, conveniently didn't respond to the text, right? That first cycle was painful. Guys, he was not consistent. When we go to the gym, you're not going like on January 1st, I can tell you right now, you might make three days and then day four, it doesn't happen. But he kept exercising the muscle. And then over time, he got better and better and better. We went like a couple of the weeks there, There was like seven days with no email. And I'm like, can we just send something out for the love of God? This house team needs something, right? Growing pains. This is part of it. I don't want you to get to or think that you have to get to where Taki is now from day one. Let's just like work through. I know Ken felt my vibe. Ken felt this. We lived through the pain. Same with his content, right? Filming his content. He would have a list of content. It's like nothing would happen. Yeah, Ken, I need you to support me here. Ken was in the battlefield with me. Ken had to like accost him when he was in Japan and like film 30 pieces of content, which are really, really good, by the way. And then whenever we had him, we're like, just pull all the content that we could out of him because he wasn't consistent. But now he's in this really good vibe. It feels good. Guys, you are exercising new muscles. This is hard. So Ken, what could be some tips, some insights for people who are starting out, whether it's for a target was writing an email, but this will also apply if they're creating content.

Kent
Thanks. I think that if you're struggling to start, then one of the best ways to re-engage an audience, like if you haven't done it in a while, is just start with your reintroduction type of email

Tamara
or short form or long form.

Kent
It's like, hey guys, I know we've been friends for a while. You've been following me on social media or somehow we did work in the past. By the way, this is what I'm doing now. And it's just such a great way to kind of reset all of previous expectations or relationships and it's no longer awkward.

Speaker 4
Like, oh, why is so-and-so pitching?

Kent
Like if you have that awkwardness, just like, hey, I used to do this, I used to do that, blah, blah, blah. But hey, by the way, I'm doing this because I want to reintroduce myself. And that sets the tone for everything you could do for the next month or two or three.

Tamara
Yeah. And here's the thing, you're mainly doing it for yourself because I can tell you right now, they're not sitting there waiting for you to reintroduce yourself. But if that is how you are going to get back into the rhythm, then do that. Agreed? your audience Taki didn't reintroduce himself uh he kind of introduced the concept of him writing his emails again and you're what look what you're wanting to do is you're wanting to look for this like these soft stats early on in the piece it's not going to result in sales from tomorrow there were these little reinforcements that he got I think Frank Kern emailed him once and was like good to see you back or something like that and he was like oh my god and he like fan like fangirls over it, right? Look at things like your open rates are slowly starting to improve. Look at things like some of the feedback that you're getting back from your emails. Look at some of the comments that you're getting. Black Belter, Paul Waddy today, finally did this piece around this insight that he had from some of his students that were coming from other programs. And I'd suggested to him that he, I was like, that's really frustrating. You should do a rant piece on that. And he did. And the thing's gone freaking viral, although he's swearing in it. So now we can't boost it, but he'll learn for next time, right? Giorgio didn't reintroduce. I just resumed as if nothing changed after dangerous and prolific or prolific and dangerous. Yeah. Just get right into it. But if you need that to make yourself feel better, do it. Your first piece of content is going to suck. So rather than saying, oh, what if it sucks? Can you just say, yeah, it's going to suck. So let's just get it out there. Let's so we can get onto the next less suckier one and we can get onto the next less suckier one. And guys, I know what I'm asking. If you guys look, I don't have content. I know how hard it is. I know what I'm asking, but also you guys are growing these awesome businesses, right? You got to get in there. Sequence for tackling the different layers of the web. Priority order. Sounds like you all started with the short form first. Okay. Do you want the timeline? I thought I explained the timeline, but we'll do it again. We've got a couple of minutes. I'm slow. Okay. It started at the beginning of last year. Do we need to draw this or you guys call if I just tell the story? Cause I don't have any spare sheets in my thing. I'm not, I'm not Mike. I wasn't good at this. Oh, hang on. Hang on. If I was to do that. Oh no, it's just going to add a thing. Hang on. Add a page. No, it's not working. I can do this. I can do this. Quick note. Guys, I use good notes. I'm not a notability person. Okay. This is how it goes. I've not thought about how to draw this, so it's going to be messy. Let's go. Let's go green. Okay. It started off Jan last year, Jan Feb. It was the beginning of last year. Now don't forget. Actually, no. It started in Hawaii. This is where we spoke to the concept of brand width. Brand width. No, I can't spell. The pressure with the... Is that how you do it? Yeah. Right. Hawaii. That was two years ago, two and a bit years ago. We introduced the concept of brand width. This is not about creating new stuff. This is about repurposing stuff. This is where the insight came about. The insight of how can we move people around your existing content. Got it? That's the concept of brand with. There is a training to watch on that. There is a deliverable out of that, which is how can you then move your indoctrination sequence to 30 days to as a quick win to be able to execute on that. Leveraging existing content, whether it's videos, blogs, all of that stuff. So from Hawaii till the end of that year, that's what the focus was on. How can we execute brand with? Then Jan 24, right, was his first six-week cycle. And it was email a day. This was the story. And sales list will explain this. The sales list experiment will take you through this cycle. Like what happened? He started with a six-week cycle. It was simple. I'm going to write. I'm going to take back the emails. I'm going to write an email a day. He was a little bit crap at the consistency part of it. And then he moved into his second six-week cycle and he got better. It was just, guys, it's going to the gym. It's exercising the muscle. Part of doing this is also how he felt doing it. Some days it was harder to do it. But as he practiced and exercised that muscle, he got better and better at it. Then, you know, this was like, gosh, guys, he even, story time, he even like called me once. I don't know if you guys all remember this. There was an email about his dog pooing on his bed. He came home and he found, I don't know. Anyway, he wrote about it and then called people to tell because he was so excited about how he linked his story to the email. and then goes, okay, now I need to go clean that up, right? He wrote it on the floor of his room. And so he was starting to get into this flow of connecting the story to the content. If you want a training on how to do this, if content is completely oblivious to you, start with 80-20 content strategy. That's going to explain the pillars, yeah? But to move beyond that and to introduce the storytelling, the social system is how Taki pulls out his story story, like the things that happens in his life. And he turns that into content, right? Now, it was about June, July, we introduced our first paid workshop last year with the concept being, when we do free workshops, we would get a lot of registrations, a lot of them being clients, prospects, not really many black belt prospects. We have a lot of people that take like their freebie chases. They just come and they don't take action. And so the concept of the paid workshop was to help eliminate that. Get the freebie chasers out of the room and focus on generating higher quality leads. Your conversions go down. It's okay. Because here we still had a sales team and the sales team needed to know who to focus their attention on and who not to focus their attention on. So we had high quality leads. We had less leads, but they were high quality, right? The sales team started to know who to put their attention on. Make sense? So don't be upset if your registration numbers are less. Let me kind of move that there. Every single paid workshop, we were testing something. We didn't teach this to you until March of 2025. So what's this? This is like June, July. Yeah. Some of you are aware of like, we did this random promo. David, I think you were actually one of the people that came in that promo. And then a few months later, you were like, guys, where's the training for that? We're like, there's no training on that. There's a reason why there's no training on it. Because we will run something multiple times and we're always testing and iterating and tweaking. And so that by the time we teach it to you, it's systematic. Okay. So no, we didn't teach you the offer thing that we did, but we did teach you the paid workshop. What happened was there was this offer that we had in June, July. Taki went and he did the ultimate sin. When you do a test, he changed two variables. The test was, can we sell from an offer doc? I think he got cold feet at the last minute because then he threw in, David, what was the offer? Do you remember?

David
Yeah, it was you don't have to pay.

Tamara
Yeah, it was like two months free.

David
Two months free.

Tamara
Right, it was two months free and we'll get you the wins and then that way you can pay for black belt because he was trying to say, okay, well, people who said they have no money, this is no excuse. This just goes to show when you offer stuff for free. Now, David is an alum of this. This is fine. But what I'm saying is the overall numbers. We saw a lot of churn at the end of the two months, even though people got wins, right? So here is where we introduced the offer doc and we introduced the paid workshop. And we introduced this random offer, which is like, nah, hell's nah. Yeah, we kept going back to the paid workshop and we were just tweaking other things along the way. Then come Christmas time. I dropped down with COVID. Ed's in Europe. His daughter gets sick. She's in the hospital. All in the same week. Poor Tony. She's got to like handle everything, do every single call. She's like, no, it's fine. It's fine. We got it. And I'm like, are you sure? And then three days before Christmas, Taki's like, yeah, screw it. We're going to do it. We're going to get the sales team and we're going to lock them in the cupboard. And we had no idea what the hell we were doing three days out. It was, we're going to go for two weeks break and we'll figure it out when we get back. We just knew that it was happening. Yeah. So sales list starts. Sales list is announced and we're all sitting there going, well, what happens to the emails. Who's going to man the inbox? Taki's like, I'll run Instagram. I'll do the Instagram inbox. That's fine. I'll do it. He lasted three days. And then think about it, guys. He'd been teaching people for ages to like respond. So then everyone's responding and no one's responding back. And Roxy and poor Vanessa, they're just like, we're like, guys, just, we can see it kind of falling apart. So you just got to be okay with it. So this was a very big risk. Okay. This is a big risk. Jan, we went salesless. It was 90 days, 90 day test. Things broke. Guys, things broke. There are people in this program right now who can attest to this. I tried to get it. Liz and Laura, if they're on the call, they tried heaps of times. They're like, we kept emailing. No one was responding. We're like, yeah, we know we weren't allowed. We have this theory that sometimes Taki has to feel the pain because otherwise, right? So sometimes we just had to let it happen. You guys want to like you want to fix everything don't get chaotic just if risk is your thing he was prepared right he was okay with it if you guys aren't prepared for the risk plan it out don't do it three days before christmas yeah march march comes along as if march wasn't busy enough with an intensive with both an in-person boardroom intensive and a black belt intensive the first time that we were doing two intensives we thought why not let's just launch a youtube channel let's go and as part of that there was like an eight series an eight-part series so design your show and build your show are the trainings on that and shortly after that the vsl dropped in fact the vsl was the first one i'm pretty sure and then what we did was we engineered some traffic to help with that launch he had already had five and four and a half thousand subscribers from like over the years, but he would never post consistently. Yeah. But we had an email list and we had Instagram followers. So what he did was every time we drop a video, we time the promotion of that video for the first hour so that we can try to engineer as much traffic to that as possible. Right. So that we're driving this traffic to the video so we can like resurrect this dead channel that has four and a half thousand subs that have never heard from us for ages. And we still do that Because that first hour is really important. What am I missing now? Paid workshops, emails. Micromagnets was kind of... I mean, look, we always had a lot of lead magnets and the concept of micromagnets kind of came in here, right? Here, micromagnet, there's next level nurture was where we introduced the concept of micromagnets training wise because we kept seeing that you guys weren't nurturing enough. Paid workshops continued over this time period, right? They got better and better. We kept optimizing and optimizing. We got to the 90-day period. And holy moly, Salesless was a success, right? 90-day success. And that's where we decided, yeah, we're going to keep doing this. And so come Mexico time, what was that, July? We had been doing so what, March, April, May, June allowed us to continue to create that consistency, that repeatability. So that come Mexico, we were able to teach Salesless. Yeah. And then obviously this, you can just see it, right? It's such an awesome concept that that paid workshop alone was one of our most successful ones yet. And so now how do you continue this engine? Now our focus is on content, right? Content is the name of the game and it's not about volume of content. It's about how we can stand out in the crowd. And so to make all of this stuff work, it starts off here. Let me do a highlighter color for you, right? Where are you guys? Yeah. So if we start off here, we start off with brand width, then we come to sales list. And then now the thing that we need to move to is webfluence because webfluence is what feeds sales list. Oh, different colors, but you get the gist. Got it? Brand width to sales list to webfluence. Confluence makes salesless work or it makes your sales calls work. Does that make sense, guys? Niels is saying he needs more consistency. Yeah. You don't need to, don't forget, you need more consistency. You have the content already. Just how can you engineer it? Go back to brand with, use the content that you've already got to start with. We didn't sit there and go, we had to get amazing with our content first. If you go back to brand with, install your connectors, connect them to stuff that you already have. Guys, we aren't in, most of you have content, even six months old, that is still really, really relevant today. Yeah. So Preston, can you hit me with the offer drop send in relation to the VSL? No, because you're thinking like a funnel, right? You think like a funnel that way. It's a web. If you're on Taki's email list, sometimes he just sends it out to the list, right? He sends it out to the list on the end of his open close. If anyone wants to see people's ads, there's an ads library on Facebook. Go to their page, go to page consistent app, transparency, go to ads library. Gabe, still curious when, where on that timeline, Taki Britain, the focus on, oh, short form. This was as the, like after the emails we were focusing on. So the 80-20 content strategy, the social system, those first two cycles, he really, we were already doing short form, but we kind of got him to do emails first. And then it was just getting into that habit because here's the thing. He's got the dopamine hit and then he's like, cool. And then like that's what motivates him. So start with like these little digestible pieces, guys. Get that little hit to encourage you to go to the next step. As soon as you turn these into big, huge projects, they feel overwhelming. They feel heavy. Start with like little minute pieces. So my challenge to you as we close out, sorry for running over, is what could be this one thing that you could tweak in your current web? Because you all have a web right now, whether you like it or not, it's just maybe a really narrow one. What could be one thing that you guys could implement this week to start engineering your web? And if you need to put in the back of your head, this little reminder, 47 minutes, how can I engineer 47 minutes? You don't have to engineer actually 47 minutes, but it's such a big number that it makes you go, crap, I need to be doing more. And it's just, I need to be moving them around more, really. Will, I need to start with a simple email a day. Totally. Giorgio, be intentional about connecting the various pieces of existing content together. Absolutely. You guys have content right now. I would rather you engineer time spent on brand, even if it's shitty brand right now, then you've got the architecture in place. Then you can work on making the content better. Yeah. Any questions? This is something guys that like Ed and I are so passionate about because we're seeing too many people going, oh, I'm just going to drive traffic to the VSL. I'm just going to drive traffic to this. No. Can you do it for us? I just, I have a map for you. There you go. Done. One thing at a time, guys. One thing at a time. cool all right i hope you guys got value from that i feel like this is the thing that brought it all together taki has the epic strategies but this is like the practicalities that are gonna put this all together yeah i'm more than happy to like review stuff throw stuff into the facebook group get people to critique stuff but just go how am i engineering 47 minutes got it all right guys have an awesome day
